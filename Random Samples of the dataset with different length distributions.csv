7s7iw5,"Last weekend my girlfriend and I got to discussing our future together and one of the topics that came up was the last name of the kids. 

In our culture, the wife is not expected to take the husband's last name but the children would be expected to have their father's last name. However, my girlfriend has proposed that at least one of our future children take on her last name. Now, I understand that we are not restricted, by any means, to what our culture dictates, but still feel uneasy about this situation.

A few points that came up in our discussion:

1. I brought up that she has her father's last name, she claimed she was an only child, and if we only plan on having one child, he or she can have my last name.

2. I claimed that it would be detrimental to our future children to grow up with different last names since that has the connotation of coming from other parents (as the result of divorce & remarriage). She responds ""then all of them can have my last name.""

3. Since we are both the only child, we both feel an equal responsibility to carry on our family lines, regardless of our own gender. 

What do you guys think would be an equitable solution to this problem?",256,Q1,1,"Girlfriend wants future children to have her last name, but I am not comfortable with that due to social conditioning and/or the backlash I would face from my own parents.",34,1,"A couple is discussing the last name of their future children.

Of course, since I'm still a senior in high school and have no stable source of income besides whatever days my parents ask me to come into their store (usually 5 minutes prior to when they need me), I told them since this will require a lawyer.

My mom cried for a bit (as did my father when he heard a family friend refer to me as ""a good kid""), and my father instantly called me an ""asshole,"" and ""druggie,"" and told me he'd rather hear that I stole shit instead of caught with drugs. They're treating me like a hardened criminal for barely having a joint.

Now they're threatening to force me to stay home for college (which would be an hour-ish away) and won't let me see my girlfriend, who they think is a bad influence, among not let me out of the house to hangout with my friends, even the non-drug using ones.

 The other night, she spent quite a while on her phone in the middle of the night. This is not unusual for her as she has terrible trouble sleeping.

My boyfriend of 1.5 years broke up with me this last Sunday, due to stress revolving his health. He explained he can't seem to feel comfort in this relationship, because he is so worried about himself and me. I have my own plethora of mental health problems, so it's understandable.


I am very hurt, because it was sudden, but I seem pretty relieved as well. Due to stress, we're both super snippy at each other and started to not enjoy each others times. We both agreed its best we break up and focus on ourselves.


My heart still hurts for him. Everything reminds me of him, and I'm having dreams of him almost every night. I wish we didn't break up, but I understand why we did.

When we first hooked up, I had a very successful career in the adult industry and I supported him for almost 2 years before he got a job. He knew what I did before we hooked up because I had been in the industry for years and everyone back home knew. He told me multiple times that he accepted it and he loved me regardless. However, He has been very abusive, always blaming it on my job before and now that I have retired since our marriage he uses my past against me during every fight. He is physically abusive; it’s happened multiple times but the worst was the morning of our wedding. Before we got married, he destroyed all of the thing in my house on two different occasions. I should add that I only decided to retire and marry him after he secured a legitimate, stable job and once I found out I was pregnant. We lost the baby and I feel resentful to him because I think his physical abuse was a direct cause.


 I guess my question is, what is wrong with me? Why do I think I love someone who can be so terribly cruel to me? Also, why do I want to make this work?

Ever since I can remember I have been an aspiring fashion designer – making clothes for my dolls out of tube socks when I had no other outlet and trying to use any fabric I could get my hands on to make anything I could when I found the gumption to. I love design.

In 2014 I taught myself how to crochet and the medium just speaks to me. Crochet design is officially my niche – I dabble with other methods but the hook and yarn are the most fulfilling. Over the past few years I've been able to build up my portfolio by doing trades and utilizing thrifted yarn and now I am confident that this is something I could do great things with given the chance.

Okay – that's great and all, but why am I asking for help?

My partner and I live with our dog and our cat in a 20' pull behind camper trailer and are barely pulling in enough income to cover our living expenses to boot. I mean, we get by, but there's never any room in our budget for extra.

Some people would go out an get a business loan for their start up. If I had the money to make payments on a loan every month I would instead save that money every month for a few years to bypass needing a loan. However – I don't have that money.

My solution has been to launch the Help Enlightened Butterfly Soar GoFundMe campaign. And in the spirit of giving – 50% of the proceeds are going to be used to make and distribute hats and scarves to charities in my area and an organization called Warmth for All next winter.

Again – that's great and all, but what am I asking for here?

7o3cgi,"ok...I'm just wondering what people's thoughts are on this. I have recently met a man ( a month ago), we seem to hit it off. I am interested to see where things go, aside from one issue.

 His last relationship was with a woman who was 20 years younger than him. She was 19 and he was 39 when they met, they were together for four years. This makes me incredibly uncomfortable, because I cannot comprehend how they would have been on equal footing maturity wise. He states he realizes how odd it is, but that it "" worked"". He does not speak of her much. Which I appreciate, after the last two men I dating spoke of their exes more than frequently.

 The only slight twist to this is that my last relationship was with a man 22 years older than myself.

 He hasn't compared them, but I almost feel hypocritical in that my relationship had a larger age gap.

 The difference being I guess, was that I was 35 and my last partner was 57 when we met....and at that time, I had raised a child into late teenage hood, have a career and so on. I am not well off financially ( being a completely single parent and massive student loans ruined that for me haha)....but I feel as though my life experiences at that point made the age difference a non issue, even though, ultimately it was , and always was.  He is getting close to retirement...I'm just starting the stage of my life where my son is a young adult and I can work more freely and have some "" me "" time and so on. I did love him though, and I "" get"" where the age thing becomes a non isssue.

7ndv9b,"Hi Reddit

Basically as the title says, my dad abused me when I was little, and I told my Mum(50f), who is separated from him, about it 3-4 years ago now. She told my sister about it a few weeks later, in front of me, with me begging her to stop, which was one of the most shameful things I can remember.

Anyway, my sister and Mum do believe me about the abuse, my mum said she always suspected something. My mum doesn't talk to my dad anymore, and I haven't since I was about 15. My sister also believes me, but still talks to my dad and sees him fairly regularly. I've always felt a bit shit about this, so since I started therapy last year, I asked her to no longer talk about him to me, and if she posts photos of him on social media to hide them from me, which I know you can do on facebook. She agreed to do this, and for the past few months I haven't seen or heard anything about him.

Today she posted a summary of her year on Facebook, including a bit about my dad and a photo of him and her together. I feel very upset and triggered, and I am not sure if it is justified.

She is also not talking to me at the moment, because I did not get her new bf a Christmas gift, as I have only met him once, and was 5 minutes late to our gift exchange. I have apologised since but she hasn't replied to me.

I am now just feeling like I cannot be bothered with our relationship, she angers very easily and we do not talk often anyway, and I do feel betrayed by her maintaining a relationship with our father. I am aftraid to phone her ever because I worry she will be grumpy, and she usually only phones when she needs to get advice or something like that.

I think I want to not see her in the future, but I don't know if I am overreacting? I also don't want to cause drama in the family, which is very stressful to me.

7ser63,"Hey everyone,


My girlfriend was looking at my phone the other day and noticed I had an app that keeps all my passwords and various info all in one place and locked with one master password. It's super useful because who wants to remember all these passwords! And it's great when I need my passport info for something, I can just check on my phone instead of getting my actual passport.


Anyway, she saw the app and says ""Hey, I didn't know you had this app. What's the password? Are you going to tell me the password?"". I ask her why she wants to know the password and she says ""I just want to know? Are you not going to tell me?"". She then spends the next 10 minutes trying to GUESS what the password is. 


She already knows the password to my laptop, email, bank account, and phone PIN. I didn't really want to tell her any of those, but I could not think of a reason why not to. When I got a new phone, she set up my new PIN and got a bit upset when I changed it. She said if I had nothing to hide, then she should know my passwords. I don't have anything to hide, so I told her. But I think giving her my master password to everything is a bit much. 


I feel really uncomfortable any time she uses my phone or my computer. Not because I'm hiding anything, but because in the past she has gone on my phone and computer to read my messages without asking me. She'll then get mad at me because I didn't tell her I texted someone, or I did text someone and used the word ""I"" instead of ""we"" (meaning me and my gf), or maybe I sent someone a picture and didn't tell them that my gf took it. She also goes on my phone/computer to check my GPS to see where I went on days that we weren't together.


Now she's brought up the master password thing again, and I don't know if I should just tell her. I don't think she'll really use the information for anything since she already knows my passwords for other stuff.

AFAIK there has been no physical abuse, but there has been geographical and emotional abandonment from mother and brother, and probably a feeling of emotional abandonment from myself.

She's smart and ambitious, but unfortunately totally lacking in self-confidence and has a habit of choosing away people and situations.

I told him that the stuff would not make me mad but the lying does. That being said it really bothers me.

I don’t trust him and it’s hard to see a future with him. Am I overreacting?

2. I don’t have Facebook and only Instagram. He is more active on FB and I admit to spying on him through my friend’s FB. 

3. I leave fairly often for extended periods for work. On one of my work trips I was gone for two weekends. I trust my BF and don’t mind if he goes out. The first weekend he said he didn’t do anything and just stayed home, yet through my friend’s FB I could see that he added three girls as friends. The next weekend one of my friends saw him out with some girls and he said that he had just met them that night. Yet when he listed the names it was the same three girls he added from FB the previous weekend. 

4. We live in a somewhat larger city and his ex still lives in the area. We have never run into her but they have some mutual friends. He has lied multiple times about his ex being at events that he has gone to. I know she was there because I saw pics on Instagram.

7os7oj,"Hi Everyone,

I've been dating my GF for about 10 months, and everything is pretty good with the relationship.  I think the two biggest weaknesses are my clinginess and her sometimes-poor communication skills.

I like to express how I feel, and I'd much rather talk about the elephant in the room, whereas she likes to sweep things under the rug.

We met at college, and her girlfriends from school have a group of guy friends.  The problem is one of these guy friends.  I'm typically pretty shy in new social settings and don't really like to make be at the focus of anyone's attention unless I'm comfortable with them.  When I first met these guys, it was like 2 polar opposites met.

I'm fairly quiet, reserved, respectful and I like to think I'm a smart person.  These friends, this one friend in particular, are loud, boorish and really rude.  He has shown interest in my GF before I came along, and he likes to try to mess with me when I'm around.  He's usually drunk, loud and spitting as he talks. 

He also gets away with all the stupid stuff he does because that's ""just him!""  He smokes in people's houses even though they ask him not to, he flirts with people's girlfriend and he's just a general pest.

I've asked my girlfriend to cut him, not her friends, out time and again, but she complains because she thinks there's no way to do that without alienating herself from her friends.

Recently, he got caught groping a girl in her sleep (she was passed out drunk) while her boyfriend went to the bathroom.  He was caught by my GF's friends and they were really upset about it, and kicked him out of the party.

My GF told me about it, and tried to justify it saying he was probably really drunk and wouldn't do that sober.  I told her I really don't want her around this guy anymore, but she was noncommittal about it, basically saying that if her friends invite him she doesn't really have much of a say in it.

Am I being unreasonable in demanding some action?  Is there a better way to ask or go about it?

7ox2v7,"My girlfriend and I have been dating for 8 months but have been very close for 2 years. A couple of months ago, her very close cousin suddenly passed away from cardiac arrest (very sudden, all within an hour, no previous illness). They were very close and my girl, who is already sensitive and feels greatly, was very affected. 

She has been very shaken up and worries constantly about everybody around her, constantly checking if the windows and doors are locked, checking to make sure people that are sleeping are breathing, not letting me drive for fear of an accident, etc. 

A month ago, she told me she was having some trouble sleeping at night and couldn't sleep through the night but downplayed it, so I just told her to text me or call me if she was upset. This week, we stayed in the same house and I slept with her. 

We were watching a movie when she went to go to sleep in the next room (she's very tired a lot). About an hour later, I heard her crying uncontrollably and shaking and screaming. It was really hard to see.

I held her until she went back to sleep, and then stayed with her. She awoke two more times that night but didn't scream or cry or anything like that, she just opened her eyes, leaned into me closer, and went back to sleep.

In the morning, she told me she has never had so much sleep in one night for over a month. So, to help her, I continued letting her sleep on me for the next three days. No issues, she awoke less and less, and when she did, she simply went back to sleep.

Then, yesterday, I was working a late shift. When I got home to her, around 1 in the morning, I found her sitting on the kitchen floor in the dark, crying, hands pulling her hair and everything. It took me half an hour to calm her down.

We've obviously realized that she can sleep fine if I'm there, but I'm hardly ever sleeping next to her. What is she supposed to do? I try to stay on the phone and talk to her, but it's not the same.

My partner and I have been living together since September. I moved to a different state to be with him. I moved into his home and started going to school. The entire transition has been awful. The stress of changing that many things in my life at once has been beyond difficult. I found a new therapist today which should be helpful. I don't have any friends in this city, and it's just too hard for me right now to sum this up on a phone call. I'm also embarrassed, and I feel so stuck.

My partner is a (former?) heroin addict. I've known this from the beginning, but I assumed it had been awhile since he told me so. No need to dig up his past; I was also a drug user. Things were fine when I first moved in. We were both pretty busy. He's working on his second master's at a very good school and has a pretty serious job, but he's new to it. The long hours working on an international team for a venture capital firm has to take its toll while studying at a prestigious school. He was still himself though.

The past two months have been gut-wrenching watching him transform. Our holiday break was going okay, but it's where I started to get suspicious. He had gotten a few Xanax for us to use on the plane/during the stress of it all. I took 1/4 of one when my anxiety spiked very bad (because of him). He acted so strange, and it was prime time to use because we were going to our hometown where it would be much easier for him to score.

We have had a single meal together in the past month, and we've had sex once. He didn't even get off. Red flags abound... sneaky texts to numbers that aren't saved in his phone, a razor blade with white powder on his desk that I tasted (tastes like a fucking opioid, obviously). I found pills in his car. I found needles in his Amazon history. I found emails to dealers on Craigslist. He has all these receipts from the same McDonald's 1.5 hours away from us, and on the entire other side of the bay from where he normally works. There is no reason he would be a regular there? There are ripped off Q-tips in his car. He threw up in his car trash can. He nearly passed out the other night after having a serious cold spell, passed it off as a random seizure (why the fuck would he have a seizure?). He is up for 2-4 nights in a row without a lick of sleep. He's lost weight and he's pale. He hardly eats real food despite me cooking it - just junk food. I AM NOT THE KIND OF PERSON WHO GOES THROUGH INBOXES AND TRASH CANS. Why is this my life?!

He told me he sold the pills back. He told me he threw the needles out and never used them. Every story doesn't add up. There are so many holes and no evidence to prove his rebuttal(s). I'm so devastated. I am so hurt. My parents were addicts. My exes were addicts. It's not the drugs or the behavior. It's feeling like I'm not worthy of the truth. I found drugs as a child all the time, my parents sweeping my discoveries under the rug as though they weren't *drugs.* They were! That's how I started using them! 

This man is so thoughtful, kind, patient, and understanding. He's the most intelligent person I've ever met. I've learned so much about the world and about what it means to be human from him. Addicts are not bad people, but they are bad liars. I've lost two of my best friends to heroin and my father to addiction. I made it out alive a long time ago, and I want nothing to do with this anymore.

After writing this out, I realize the evidence I have is so strong and the consensus is probably clear. I just don't understand why I can't get the truth from him.

I'm in school full-time and he's been mostly supporting me financially besides my financial aid. I just started this quarter, and as much as I absolutely hate being in school, it would be awful to drop out because of this. I can't afford to live anywhere around this area by myself! I have friends in different cities around the state who would gladly help me which is keeping me sane. I hate not having any support in real life here. I spend all day on the verge of tears lately. I miss being myself.

I have given him an ultimatum. I would like concrete proof that he hasn't been using (whatever the fuck that is), or I would like the truth so we can communicate effectively, so I can support him in whatever he is going through, and so that we can heal. Is there anything else I can do? I'm not going crazy, right? Yes - I've been actively looking for this stuff, but there is no way this was a one-off, ""bought some pills on a bad night and regretted it"" incident. The evidence is there, and it is only growing stronger.

I have no car and no money. He told me he'd help me start over if I decided to leave. I just don't know what to do.

85stwn,"I missed the primary elections two years ago because two years ago yesterday, my ex dislocated my arm in three places in the wee hours of the morning and threw my car/house keys into his lawn in the dark and rain. I was still trying to get it back together because I couldn't explain it at the ER and I didn't want insurance make me have to face him in court. I should have seen it coming. Three months before that, he screamed in my face and grabbed me by the shoulders. I ignored the blazing red flags. I still experience daily pain. Roughly twelve hours before that he'd shoved me over the couch (I have a serious back injury which I finally had my spine fused for recently, and that has long been a huge no no for me) and yanked my pants down to try to fuck me while his 4 y.o. daughter was in the bathroom. He was angry he didn't succeed because she finished using the bathroom too quickly. I was shocked because he hadn't done anything like that in the 11.5 months we'd been together, but as a testament to my prior experiences with abuse, I saw it as nothing terribly abnormal. This was what I'd always known relationships to be, whether it be family, friends, or intimate relationships.

I was supposed to move in with them in a couple weeks. I wanted to wait until a year in, because I knew deep down he was a bad guy, but I wanted to be wrong. I wanted to be a mom (I can't have kids), and I wanted to save his daughter from the life I had growing up. He used this all against me. He's a narcissist and has some severely anti-social tendencies. 

Last night I had a nightmare involving me babysitting for him and his ex-wife, and their friends drugging me to rape me when they brought the party home. It brought back all the bad and my husband (we met two years ago next month) has super-hearing abilities and heard me crying while he was in the bathroom getting ready for work. He came out to hold me. Now he's gone and I'm crying again, damn it. It brought back all the memories of all the physical and sexual assaults and rapes I've experienced. People like that can smell a victim a mile away. 

The shame is so overwhelming right now. That I let it happen. My entire life. From the first time I didn't say anything aged six. I just want to forget. I don't want to feel these people touching me. So many people, so many times, I've literally lost count. The things I've let happen because I never understood that people who love you don't hurt you like that. Things I let happen because I was conditioned to believe from such a young age that that is what life is. Hiding, hurting, and being used. Because I never saw the value in myself as a person. I still don't. I'm a garbage person. 

My husband was the first to tell me that it wasn't normal to let myself be an object. A fuck toy and a punching bag. I had just accepted my fate that it was my place to be used and abused. That my normal was to live in fear of being hurt or fucked. I was 34 when we met. Now, after all the years of being used like a Kleenex, I feel so dirty, ashamed, and undeserving of someone as wonderful as he is. I feel like if he truly knew all that had happened, all the things I let happen, though I've shared a lot with him, that he would be disgusted. He's a better person than that, I know. But I feel unworthy of love, and unworthy of the safety I have with him now. This morning I told him I often wonder if I'd met him sooner, if I'd believe him or just brush him off as some bullshit fairytale who would eventually hurt me in the same ways. It did take a long time after we got together to believe he wouldn't, but now I actually believe he'd lay down his life to protect me. And I don't think I deserve that.

I'm just so sad and filled with so much self-loathing today. The memories literally make me sick, make me vomit, which I don't need to be doing right now after a major surgery. I just want to erase it all. A couple months ago I asked my psychiatrist if ECT would make me forget. Apparently it doesn't work that way. I don't drink or do drugs anymore (which didn't help keep me safe at all btw) so there is nothing to blur it out. I just have to live with all the horror and memories and I hate it.",976,Q3,1,I hate myself and the life I led.

7pd36r,"We've been together for over 5 months now. It's been the happiest 5 months, being in a relationship, of my life. This is his first relationship, so we've gone through some small bumps. I feel that the biggest problem we have now, is that he wants this ""perfect relationship""  I can't give that.

He defines a perfect relationship as a relationship where both people can give and take each others firsts (first time). I feel that this is a lot to ask for, and when I expressed my feelings he would become upset, saying things such as ""well I'm sorry I want something like this"". Those kinds of hostile things, and I honestly don't know how to reply to something like that. I mean, what can I do? I don't see any way I could do anything about it.

A few days ago he asked me to tell me the things I've done in my past relationships. I personally felt a bit uncomfortable with this topic, as it is something that is difficult for me to open up about, but I told him anyway.

He didn't take it very well  and maybe it's too much for me to ask, but the least he could've done was shown any sort of support for my opening up to something so huge.

After I told him, he became livid. Said that he regretted not meeting me earlier (before I dated my ex)...I didn't know how to react.
Later on that night he starts saying that he ""doesn't know if he wants this (relationship) anymore"". Being the type of person I am, I apologize for upsetting him. I begin to push for us to talk it through, because I felt that it was something we could get through if only we talked. For hours he kept giving me short responses, constantly telling me ""I don't know"". This continues for another three days.
No matter what I say, or do, I feel hopeless. I feel like at this point, I'm the only one putting effort into our relationship. I've suggested taking time to ourselves so that he could think things through, taking a break, talking about it, meeting up (we really only can see each other on the weekends due to classes), etc. Still, the short responses.
He's started to not respond to me; we talk through an app that shows when the other has read the message. I know his class schedule, so I know when we can answer back (he checks his phone often). It's just frustrating to me that he really should, but does not answer back to me  and when he does it's short responses. I could send something really long, but it doesn't seem like he cares at this point.
He'll constantly tell me that he's ""trying his best"", but I honestly don't feel that his ""best"" really is. I don't feel any effort coming from his side.

Maybe it's too early to tell what I should do, but it's been really stressful and hard for me. I feel that he's asking for too much, and I'm starting wondering if he really loves me for me(and that's why he hasn't left yet) or if he just really wants this ""perfect relationship"".
He knows that I can't give it to him and it's just not gonna happen. He doesn't know if he'll ever get over this, as it is something he's wanted for a very long time. I don't know how to feel or what to do. I feel like I've tried my hardest, but I'm not getting the same feeling back from him. I really love him, from the depths of my heart, and it hurts me when he says things like this. I feel terrible for not opening up to him earlier, but at the same time I feel like it was such a huge thing for me to do so I'm very conflicted. What are your opinions? What should I do? Is it really too much or am I just being selfish? Is there anything I should ask/try?

I know this is really long, but if you've read up to here thank you. It means a lot.

9s2hhc,"My boyfriend \[26\] of over two years never hit me \[f,25\] for real. The first time I even considered if he was physically abusing me was this June. We were fighting about something and one thing let to another he started pushing me and than threw me on the floor. I had no bruises or anything, it didn’t even hurt at all. But it felt wrong, mostly because of his expression when he did that. I had seen him angry like that a couple of times before but he never got actually violent. This time was different. I got scared, not because he might seriously injure me (I still don’t believe he can, or not just yet at least), but because I never knew this side of him. Otherwise he is a very shy person, even a bit too much to my opinion. Never gets into confrontations with people other than in his close circle. Avoids eye contact with strangers and stuff like that, which I used to find cute at the beginning of our relationships. But there we were. When I started crying it didn’t calm him, he kept being angry and kind of teased me for my tears. Than he said something about wanting me to leave his house (he is renting and I am completely financially dependent on him) and left for work. 



I expected him to be extremely sorry after realizing what he had done. That didn’t happen. During the day he just messaged me he is ready to talk and I don’t have to leave. That evening I didn’t let him home because I’ve got actually concerned he might do something like that again, since he didn’t even admit anything of importance happened. The next day we talked. It got me a lot of time and persuasion to explain to him that what he had done was not right. Eventually he sort of agreed but my point was weak since it was not real beating and he got triggered because I wanted to escape the fight by leaving the room and giving him silence treatment. (He mentioned many times before it hurts him when I do this).



Everything was okay until the beginning of October. Something like that happened again. He was angry with me and wanted me to go to another room so he didn't have to look at me but I wanted to stay (not getting involved in any conflict or anything, just doing my studying and not interacting) so he took me out of the room by force, not hard again, but I got hysterical nonetheless. After calming down I continued my studies in the kitchen, trying not to think of what had happened and where this relationship was going. In about an hour he came to me and it looked like his anger was unresolved as he was provoking me. I decided not to get involved because this time I was genuinely frightened of what was going on. So I saw the best way out of this in keeping silence and just wait it out. Sure enough it got him mad so he started saying nasty things and pushing (or poking even) me in the head. Not painfully, just in humiliating manner enough to get emotion out of me. So he got. I hit him in the head really hard a couple of times. Which I actually am very proud of for standing up to myself but it still hurt a lot feeling the need to do this towards the one I love. And then I left the house staying with friends for a couple of days. 



There’s probably too many details already so I’ll try to keep it short. That time we made peace again and it was okay until yesterday. He was sleeping when I sat at the foot of the bad in his legs with a laptop. I tried to be quiet but he woke up anyway and told me to leave in a very rude manner. I do not let people talk to me like that (even if those people might hit me) so I refused. Again, word after word, he got mad and started kicking me. And again, no bruises but the same violent look on his face. He was asking “what, am I hitting you again? This is all in your head” and stuff like that. So I hit him with the laptop and left the room. 



I do not know what to make of all this. The way things are I am not innocent as well. Yeah, violence from my side always happens in self defence but I try to make sure I hit hard when I do. Does it mean we are both abusing each other? Also, silence treatment is said to be a sign of abuse, but only me is the one doing it in our relationships when I don’t want to take part in a conflict and want to cool off by myself. And what concerns me the most is how this sweet person I know can feel so violent emotions towards me? How can he look at me like that when otherwise it feels we are meant for each other? He does so much to support me sacrificing his own interests at times. How can it be the same person? Am I the one who made him like this? He has no history of abuse, but that is his first relationships ever so there’s probably no chance of knowing an answer to that. But the most ridiculous thing is that he knows all the stuff about abuse, we talked about such things and used to be joking on the subject. Then how can he be oblivious to the fact that what he is doing is wrong? Does it mean I misinterpret something? (I know it might look like blaming myself and justifying his behaviour, but not all people who say or feel they are being abused are actually experiencing this, do they? So I try to be cautious in my deductions).


How to know where I might actually be in the wrong and where does he cross the line?",1163,Q3,1,"My boyfriend tends to become violent, but he haven’t seriously hit me.

7i2lpo,"Hello, Reddit!

My story is very long and complicated. There are a lot of reasons why I got in my current situation to begin with. There are even more reasons that I need to leave my current situation. I can't type in detail about it publically, on the off-chance that the person I am with (an abusive partner) will come on this website and see this post. But basically, it is strong emotional abuse that has become physical at times, from both the person I am with and their mother. (Again, I cannot speak in any kind of detail publically) I am more than willing to divulge every single detail of my entire situation to anyone who asks me privately via the accounts I linked at the end of this post.

Why don't I go to the police or an abuse shelter? I get asked this every time I talk about my situation, and the answer is simple. If I go to either of those places, I will just end up homeless. Shelters and the police are there to help people get out of abusive homes, and *into new homes with pre-existing friends or family that the abused person has arranged with those people.* As I mentioned previously, I have no pre-existing friends or family who are able/willing to help me. So, if I go to a shelter, I will be able to stay for a few months, sure, but what about after the time limit is over? I'll just end up on the streets. 

Why don't I get a full-time job and find a roommate in my immediate area? There are complications with this as well. First, I do not have a car, nor does my part-time job pay me enough for me to be able to afford a car in any reasonable amount of time. The reasons I can't find a full-time job have to do with issues within the area that I live in. However, the issues are specific and apply only to this area out of the entire United States, so I cannot divulge the reasons publically, or I will risk being found out if the person I'm with sees this.
In summary, I have thought things through and it is simply impossible to get out of this situation without seeking out someone who lives outside of the area I live in and would be willing to take me in as a roommate and be accepting of my conditions. So, now onto that!

What I need is not money, my job pays me enough to save a decent amount of cash. I won't accept any monetary donations - other people out there need cash more than I do. I am fine with money for what I need at this moment. What I need is to be allowed into someone's place to live, be it out of the goodness of their heart, as a friend, or as a roommate.

It doesn't matter where you live - I am literally fine *anywhere* in the United States, outside of my current area, which I am happy to divulge privately. (except Alaska or Hawaii, the plane ticket would cost too much to get there) Most likely I would be taking the bus. From there, I can take an uber to your place if I can't be picked up. If you don't live too many states away, I could take a plane. I'll have money to afford a way there, this isn't the issue.
Now, to the issues with me being a roommate/guest/friend in your home, to see if these are things that you can be okay with if you'd like to help me:

My first and main issue with living with someone else that will end up burdening them the most is that I do not have a car. Once I got there and got a job, I would do my best to set aside whatever money I could for a car. (I don't have the credit to buy a car with a car payment, and I hate that too, I would just buy a cheaper one outright) But until then, I would need transportation to job interviews and to work. Of course, once I have a job, I am happy to compensate for gas! Additionally, if your city has a good bus system, I could take the bus instead. (If our schedules don't match up and I have to be dropped off/picked up hours and hours before/after my shift, it doesn't bother me!)

The second issue is that, of course, I wouldn't have an immediate job there unless you are a manager somewhere or know a manager who can hire me as soon as I got there. My resume is okay, not great, but not trash. (I'm happy to share privately!) I have retail, grocery, and resteraunt experience, less than a year for each job. I haven't had the chance to go to college yet, but I would like to as soon as I can. So, I can only do minimum wage jobs such as retail, grocery, or resteraunts. Maybe receptionist/office if they're willing to hire me. I got straight A's and B's in high school but no one cares about that. =P But anyway, I promise I would fill out job applications for most of the day each day until I got a job! I've done it before, in a similar situation! I have experience with this sort of thing. But, even so, depending on the area you're in, it could take a while... For sure, I would need someone who would not charge me rent until I found a job. (and no charging rent after I find a job for the duration of time I couldn't pay) Additionally, for the rent itself, since minimum wage jobs are trash and don't pay well, I'd like to only accept rent that someone with a part-time job could reasonably afford (because often the only job you can get at those places is just part-time! I don't want to accept a rent price that I won't be able to afford if I can't get full-time). So, if the minimum wage in your area is $7.25 - $8/hr, then the highest rent I would accept would be $250 per month. I need the other half of my pay for food (and gas compensation or bus fare)! Basically, whatever the minimum wage in your area is, assume I work 20 hours a week... I am only willing to pay half of what I would make in a month. If that is not something you can be okay with, then I can't be your roommate, sorry! (But if I did find a full-time job, of course I would be happy to pay more - but please don't count on that!!)

I am planning on bringing hopefully a few hundred dollars (I'll try to bring as much as possible) to buy food and anything else I need until I find a job there. If I run out of food money, if you just buy me ramen to eat every meal, I will be thankful. <3
And that's it, really, as far as issues go that wouldn't arise with a normal roommate. I don't have a car, might take some time to find a job and to help financially, and I don't want to pay over half my paycheck in rent.

As far as other things go, I don't really care! I don't care if you have any pets. I don't care if you smoke or drink or do weed. I don't care if you never clean the house! (I have a dog but most likely won't be able to bring her, and I personally never ever smoke, drink, or do drugs) I don't care if you bring home different people each night and screw them! xD I don't care if I can't have my own room. I don't care if I have to sleep on a couch, the floor, or anything else.
My situation is *very* bad and there isn't much that would make me unwilling to accept help if it follows my conditions! It'd be cool if I didn't have to say this, but given the world we live in, I have to, but... I'm not willing to do non-mutually consenting sexual favors for anyone in return for a place to stay, regardless of your gender! If you are someone who would invite someone like me in and then turn around and demand that shit, please don't even message me! I'm not going to waste my time, I will sooner walk out of your home and be homeless if you try that shit with me, okay? Because even being homeless in an area outside of here is better than living where I currently am. Additionally, if you end up being abusive or anything like that, I will also just walk out, so don't bother.

Now, as for how I am as a person living in a home! Because I can definetly understand others not trusting me, either. Well, I am definetly the quietest person you will ever find. I never speak or use my voice unless I absolutely have to. It's a lot harder for me to speak what I feel than to just type it. As you can see, I can write walls and walls of text when I need to say things. But, if I were to try and talk about this, I wouldn't be able to say anything well. In addition to never speaking unless absolutely required or desired from someone else, I always use headphones for everything! I never play music or any sounds whatsoever through my laptop or phone's speakers. I can't stand playing anything through my speakers that other people can hear! In fact, I wish TV's had headphone jacks, too! But even on the TV, I play my sound as low as possible in order to hear it. When other people blast their music or sounds, I don't mind at all, but I refuse to ever do that myself. So, you will find no other person who is quieter than I am to live with! Especially when someone is sleeping, I go out of my way to not make a single sound as much as possible.

While I don't care about the following things either way, I know it's important to others, especially older people, so I'll go ahead and state again that I do not, and have NEVER smoked cigarettes or done drugs or weed or anything. I drank an alchoholic beverage a few times in my life but it has no effect on me and I don't ever drink. I would never be interested in trying any drugs or getting into them, either. I don't think they're necessarily bad, I just don't need them or care. My age is in the early 20's (will divulge specific age privately). I'm also not the sort of person who will bring people home to date and have sex with them and stuff. I prefer to be asexual unless someone I deeply love really wants it from me. I'm also incredibly picky with romance. I don't make friends in real-life easily, either (because of a lack of shared interests) so I won't be bringing people over or anything, either.

I am a very clean person, I take showers every day and all that. I make sure my own space is kept clean and organized. My temperment is extremely calm. I can get angry but it takes something very serious and personal to set that off. If I am not at work or doing chores/errands, I am almost always just on my laptop, playing an MMORPG or drawing, or watching anime. I never bother anyone unless I absolutely have no other choice, even if I am friendly with them. I'm not lazy - I don't mind washing the dishes or helping to clean or anything like that. I'm already used to being treated like a slave, so there's not much you could ask of me that would bother me! I like having peace. I absolutely avoid confrontation unless I literally have no other choice.

If needed, I have someone who is very close to me who is willing to give their honest opinion about me as a person to anyone who wants to ask (privately, of course). I have other people who can vouch for me as well, though they are all online friends of course.

As far as other things go that could bother some people... I'm not religious. I believe there is truth and goodness to be found in every belief system. There is also hypocricy and evil to be found in every belief system, as well. While I refuse to be forced into becoming a member/believer of any organized religion, I have no issues with supporting or partaking in anything at all, even going to any church. It is my desire to help make the world a better place through any means available. That being said, I am an absolute and full supporter of LGBT+ rights, and I personally will not support anything that goes against that. Additionally, I am Bisexual myself, so if that makes you uncomfortable, then I can't be your roommate. =P Also, I'm a girl!

Honestly, I'm a very reasonable and responsible person. I've had to be independent from very early on in my life, so I am used to it all. Trust me, I've been treated like shit by every adult I have ever lived with after a certain point in my life, so I have a high tolerance. I am used to everything around me burning into nothingness (metaphorically), and the possibility of it happening again being high at all times. I've been through shit, and I'm happy to talk all about it privately. It's easy for me to keep calm under pressure, and there's not much in this world anymore that would actually bother me at this point or surprise me. And honestly I'm very charitable as long as I don't dislike someone. I'd do anything I could to help with anything! Even if you need a shoulder to cry on, I'm happy to do that. <3
Other things that are good about me... well, I can cook really well! I can make anything as long as I have a recipe. I can also draw anime art, too, though I'm still an amateur (I can show it privately!). My other interests include being a huge anime fan, MMORPGs (I play World of Warcraft currently!), learning to play instruments, writing, cooking, spirituality, supernatural, basically anything really.

This is getting insanely long, so I need to start wrapping it up! So, as for when I'd like to be able to move in with someone, right now I am still working on saving money. I'm looking at possibly the end of January - end of February? Early March at the latest? I'm posting this early so that I can speak with as many people as possible who may be willing to help and see which situation sounds the best for me! And I think it's important to get to know someone for a bit before making a decision to live together. I'm happy to send pictures of me, talk via voice, webcam, or whatever. The major restriction I have is that it will have to be at specific times because my abusive partner is home most days. I also will have to speak with anyone on secret messaging accounts when the abusive partner is not home, so I am not always available to talk about this but I check those accounts as much as possible.

Due to anticipated trolling and people just asking questions that I've already answered (like telling me to go to a shelter instead), rather than coming back to all these posts (I'm posting this on a ton of websites) to see the replies, I'm just going to let anyone who is serious about speaking to me message me privately through the following places.

7rm9ab,"I have some savings from a lawsuit I was involved in as a teenager. It’s nothing huge, but it’s a lot more than most people my age have. I also until recently worked a decently paying full time job.

I recently lived with a couple I was friends with, who I have posted about on this sub before. During the time we lived together, I paid $2,000 in rent for them because they kept telling me they didn’t have rent money the night before it was due.  This was done with the understanding that they would pay me back later, but they never seemed to be able to. The few times they did have rent money were because they asked someone else to pay it for them. They both had jobs, so I do not and have never understood why paying rent was such an issue.

Eventually, due to this and other problems, I decided to move out at the end of December. I told them this in October, and they got upset because they couldn’t afford to move somewhere else, citing security deposit fees as their main concern. I gave them $1000 out of my savings, stating to them that it was for a deposit.

For about the last month, the man (who I will call A for convenience) has been telling me he has $400 for me and he’ll get it to me soon. He has not done so.

Recently, my fiancé and I got the security deposit check for the old apartment in the mail. Half of it was paid by us, half of it was paid by the other couple. However, because the other couple’s share comes out to just under what they owe me, my fiancé and I had planned to keep their share and forgive the rest of their debt. I tried to deposit the check, but since it has all four of our names on it, I was told all four of us have to be present. So I had to get in contact with them.

Obviously they weren’t happy that I wanted to keep their share. The way they see it, because they paid the deposit in the first place, the money is theirs. They also said they need $1200 for a new deposit. I reminded them of the $1000 I gave them for a deposit and the $400 A supposedly has, but apparently they spent all that money on rent for November (which they previously told me was paid for by A’s dad), food, and gas (they share a hybrid car).

The way I see it, the money is mine since they owe it to me, and since I already tried to ensure they had enough for a deposit it’s not my problem that they spent that money, Still, I told them that I would let them have $1200 if they sat down with me, came up with a plan to pay me back in monthly increments, and put it in writing. They eventually agreed to this but were very reluctant because they don’t know what their financial situation will be in the future and they feel I should just trust them to pay it back when they can.

At one point the conversation got ugly and I accused them of only caring about my money. I know I should not have done this, but I did it because ever since I told them I was moving out they’ve treated me terribly (there are details about that in my previous posts) and because A took to social media to talk about how I’m a bad friend and toxic person. I also accused them of lying about their finances, because I truly do not see how everything they’ve told me can add up. They got super insulted, said nothing they could possibly do could ever be enough for me, accused me of having a victim complex, accused me of not caring enough that the woman attempted suicide (which I didn’t know about but she swears I did), and said I’m the one who obviously values money over their friendship.

Look, I’m not usually one to care about money. I consider myself a leftist, and the way I see things, everyone is entitled to the necessities they need to live. It’s why I was okay with paying so much rent for them in the first place. But I don’t have a job anymore. I’m trying to get one again, but I have historically had a hard time finding employment. I have my own rent and bills to pay. I need to get into therapy, and I want to go back to school someday. I don’t want to continue to take care of two people who won’t even try to take care of themselves. If I were really well off it’d be a different story, but I am currently just barely able to afford things I need.

So what do you think? Am I missing something? Am I being unreasonable to think that because they owe me money, this money is mine?",977,Q3,1,"I lent money to roommates for rent.

61qatw,"Hi all, kind of stuck with ideas. I've just come back from college for spring break and have already had to deal with some of my crazy Asian mother's outbursts. When I was younger, she would beat me regularly, many times for no reason. 

An example of how crazy she would get: One time I came up to her and I don't remember what I did to deserve it (maybe she didn't like the way she thought I was looking at her) but out of nowhere she punched me right in the face. I remember not being able to process what had happened even after hearing the sound of my nose crack and seeing the blood from my nose drip all over my textbook that I happened to be holding. When I went to the kitchen to clean off my nose and textbook, she followed me there later and said ""Oh, your nose is bleeding? It's because you need to drink more water."" She's just an overall despicable woman who afaik has no real friends because of her strong mistrust of everybody. She's in such denial of everything she's done to me that I have to keep reminding myself that I'm not the crazy one and that it's not just a case of my ""being a bad kid.""

When CPS got involved in high school she stopped hitting me but the verbal abuse is still here and I think it's gotten worse. I think it's because she's slowly realizing she's losing control of me now that I'm at an age where I can decide to exclude her entirely from future if I want to (I'm 20, F). 

Not too long ago we were arguing and she said she ""wishes some guys would sexually harass me on the train ride back to college so I can understand how lucky I am to have her in my life"" after I refused to take her offer for a ride back to college that night. I understood she was actually worried for my safety and the thought of me going back when it was dark but something in her mind turned her concern into this ugly thing. After I left the house she kept calling me dozens of times. I picked up the first time just to tell her to stop calling after she said she was sorrysorrysorry and kept trying to get me to let her drive me again. I turned off my phone for a while and to my horror later got a message from my housemate saying my mother was at our college apartment. It turns out she drove all the way to my college and showed up before I made it there (roommates let her in and she convinced my step-dad that I ""forgot something at home"" hence her showing up) where she waited until I had to call my step-dad to ask her to leave. This was disturbing to me since I considered my college apartment to be the one place where I don't have to see or deal with her during the whole year. (I get stressed out just thinking about her and even broke down in the middle of a PE class in HS out of fear of being hit by a flying ball.) Since that incident, I've stopped telling her my college address anymore. I've adopted a hard attitude towards her, despite days when she's relatively calm, since she's shown no regret or acknowledge for the things she's done. She thinks everyone is out to get her and even blames me when she drives a wrong turn even when I've said nothing. I also know that she tries to get a peek at my Facebook screen to see who I'm talking to (she'll refer to person X that she wouldn't otherwise know and thought 'anime' was a drug so she brought it up in an argument lol) so I've been conscious about not leaving my laptop unattended anymore.

She's also super controlling of other people around her; she would get jealous of my step-dad talking to his overseas cousin on the phone and controls every cent he makes even when he's not selfish about money to begin with. I've also lost all respect for my mother after I found out she was asking my grandma where she was keeping all her money a week before my grandma passed away a few months ago. I later found out that this was the reason why my grandpa was upset and yelled at her but at first she made it sound as if my grandpa was just being crazy for no reason. For some reason she would much rather believe everyone around her is crazy rather than the opposite. Even during the weeks leading up to my grandma's death, my mother would verbally abuse my grandparents as she was serving as their caretaker; she would come over to clean as she was supposed to (she was getting paid for it) but at the same time try to demand appreciation/respect. ""Look how dirty you're living, how would you even live without me, watch me not come next week and see what happens"" she'd say as she stood in front of the TV waving the dustpan while me and my grandparents were trying to enjoy the little time we saw each other. She similarly pulls guilt-trippy things like that with me too, as if raising me was such a huge favor on her end rather than a legal responsibility. Sorry that went off on a tangent; there's so much more I can say about her crazy attitude. I don't understand how people can treat people they say they love like that.. She says ""one day when you have children you'll understand"" but she doesn't understand that I'm afraid to have children now, out of fear that I will end up being terrible to them like she has been to me. She had me when she was very young and I could feel some of the resentment she had towards me as I was growing up because of my role in limiting her options. At the same time she cares about me in a way that's hard to understand, like in a ""no one can hurt you except me"" kind of way.

Luckily I don't have to see her during most of the school year but unfortunately I have nowhere else to stay when I'm back home in San Francisco. Staying with other family members isn't an option since because I think they're busy enough with their own households and they all live too close by anyway. We have a small studio apartment and my bed is in the living room so I can't really shut & lock a door on her so she still comes right up to my bed and tries to yell at me even as I'm sleeping. I've only been back for a day and I'm already stressed out and tired of crying. Her favorite things to say are ""It's some guy you're talking to that's making you talk to me like this, huh?"" or ""the past is the past, you make yourself stressed"" whenever I retort and try to show her how crazy she is by bringing up things she's done. She's even blamed ""someone outside the family messing with us"" for her getting 2 parking tickets in the same day once lol. Talking sense into her is no option. I'm stupid to try to even use logic with her, knowing I'll always end up in the same cycle with her. I think part of me keeps hoping that some small voice of reason in her mind will realize how hypocritical she is and how hard she's made life for the people around her. She doesn't even work (which I've come to realize is because she can't keep a job for more than a year without having some problem with the boss) so she's at home all day finding things to complain about. She doesn't pay for my tuition yet constantly puts me down by calling me dumb. 

Anyone have any tips on how to survive the next week? So far I've been playing super loud music in my headphones whenever she tries to come up and say something to me but I'm looking for options that are less likely to end up in my going deaf haha. Any tips for how I can quickly forge a future without her in my life would be helpful too.

7t5r0k,"Apologies for the length but this is my last resort.

We have been together for over 2 years. We get on so well. Same interests. Talked about marriage/moving in etc. We do not live with each other yet, however very close with her family.

We never really had sex that regularly in the early days of our relationship but that didn't bother me so much as I don't have a high libido.

Over the course of two years, we have been having sex less and less purely because she has problems down below. I do have a higher libido that her though, and there were nights where i'd make a move and get constantly rejected, leaving me in a mood with her as I would be horny.

This is due to her cervical ectropion that causes her pain and discharge. It has been a long ongoing battle since she has been around 19, and obviously the whole time we have been together. It has gotten worse over the past year.

The health service waiting list has been ridiculously long, and she was meant to have an appointment in January, which basically freezes the ectropion, which then ""resets"" it so hopefully the cells regrow in a normal state, pain and discharge free.

The appointment was moved back until March.

She has always been reluctant to have sex with me, but mostly perseveres. And when we do do it, we both enjoy it. It is just the anxiety that she gets that can make it difficult for her to be in the mood for it.

Recently I went on holiday with my family without her, and she told me that the last few days of the holiday caused her immense dread as she knew i'd want to have sex when I return.

I hate that it makes her feel this way as I love her with all my heart.

She is very ambitious and smart, and after graduating from University, she has got a menial, albeit active & well paid job in the service logistics industry. She doesn't want to be in the job for long, but also doesn't know what else she wants to do with her life / can do with her degree.

This all came to a conclusion and she pretty much had a panic attack in work a few days ago, because of this uncertainty and limbo, and also doesn't want to move out with me because she is not ready for it. She said her head is so fuzzy.

This led to us having a conversation about our relationship. She said she thinks she needs time to be alone so she can process and clear her head. She also said that we may not be sexually compatible, and that its unfair on me if I stay with her and put up with it.

I obviously told her I don't want to break up and she doesn't either. I offered her time alone and she was so unsure in herself that she didn't even know if she wanted to take me up on the offer. I said that I think we should wait until your appointment in March to freeze your ectropion, to see if that improves your libido. We ended up crying and cuddling each other. 

We seem fine now but i'm trying to give her a bit of space as to not overwhelm her. I want to spend the rest of my life with her, but I have also been questioning our relationship these past few days. Like what would it be like if I had a girlfriend who would have sex with me a lot more often. 

Have any of you had similar problems with your cervical ectropion and found a remedy?

Am I right to want to stay with her to see if her libido improves over time after her appointment with the gynaecologist?

I think she has doubts about our relationship because she is so stressed about her career and sexual health. Am I right to think that?

I am at a loss as to what to do. I think I will give her more space for a few weeks and see if the gynaecology appointment improves her libido afterwards. If not, I will really doubt our sexual compatibility.

7s6lqu,"I just started a new job this month. I was 'provided with' a guy from the department who is supposed to help me configure everything I need (it's a job in IT) and teach me how to do stuff. From the first moment I got the impression that he's kind of a grumpy and serious guy. He gave instructions very matter-of-fact and not overly friendly. Ok, no big deal.

But now since I've settled in a bit and have started developing stuff on my own I find him pretty unbearable. He's always grumpy as fuck, he has not smiled once since I've started. He's kinda condescending and seems to be bothered by people in general. He seems to mostly get along normally with people who have been here longer, but for example two other guys also started this month and he was very agressively demeaning about both when they were not present - basically raging and saying their work is shit and they should not be working here. He pushed the issue again and again and honestly I thought it was bullying but nobody really seemed to care about his behaviour. One of the new guys has already called in sick for about a week now.

He is not that mean to me, but I find him highly irritating. For example he will just randomly edit code I've written without telling me anything which will then lead to confusion. It would be fine if he tells me what I've done wrong of course, but he will just revamp everything without saying anything although the issue is already assigned to be checked by someone else, and then they will be confused because 'I suddenly changed everything', but it wasn't me! Or he suddenly stands behind me and says/yells 'I've changed (insert thing here)'. Often without saying what issue he is talking about. So I have to ask: wait, what exactly did you change how and where? He just goes, again: 'well, (thing)!' And after like 5 min through persistent asking I can finally get him to say what the fuck he is even talking about.

He is also a smoker and often goes on the balcony to smoke. That's fine but the balcony is directly next to me and whenever he is there, he's kinda standing behind me and can look at my screen. It happened several times that I turned around for some reason and saw that he was staring at me /my desk with a grumpy/angry expression. 

The problem is that I feel like I cannot say anything against him because he has been with the company for a long while and seems to be kind of an expert. People often ask him for his opinion or assign tasks to him to check for errors. But I'm literally afraid of him because I feel like every second he's gonna stand behind me again and grunt at me that he changed something or completely rewrite my code. Plus, I don't know if maybe he is talking badly about me as well when I'm not there (it seems likely).

7rb9t6,"I realize this is a lot of information. I'm heartbroken and rambling. I've never loved someone so much before and I don't know what to do with myself right now, so any advice will help.

Some general background: I started dating one of my best friends four months ago. We had been good friends for three years but both dated other people. Though we both had crushes on each other we weren't sure if the feelings were reciprocated. She also has some self esteem issues and told me that she wasn't ready to date someone like me three years ago when we first met, because I was ""too intimidating"", but instead ""settled"" for her ex. She dated that ex for two years, but never seemed that interested in him. She would complain about feeling like a caregiver for him (he was seriously depressed to the point where she had to make doctor appointments for him) and always talked about wanting to be with someone who was more independent and had their life together. As her friend I remember her saying she felt like he was good for her at the moment, but that she knew it wouldn't last forever (side note: she was open about her feelings with him, and he agreed to just enjoy things in the moment, though I'm sure he was secretly hopeful she would change her mind).

After they broke up, we grew even closer. She confessed that she wishes she hadn't let things drag on with her ex. We talked a lot, until 6 months after their break up (and a few bad rebound dates for her) she told me she had feelings for me. I told her they were reciprocated and we started dating. The first few months of the relationship were the best months of my entire life.

My issuse: The relationship was great until I started experience serious anxiety. I was hit with unexpected financial difficulties last month, and am still at risk of having to drop out of school and move in with my parents while I work off some debt (I only have two classes left but am having serious issues with student loans right now). I have been an anxious mess since this started happening. Even though my girlfriend and I had only been dating for three months at this point I started using her as an emotional crutch since we had been friends for three years. I would text her in a panic while she was at work whenever I had an appointment with the school or the bank. I was caught up in my own issues. I thought that because she loved me she'd be there for me no matter what.

The break: She told me a week ago that she feels like something is missing from our relationship. She said the idea of spending time with me just stresses her out, instead of exciting her like it used to. I realized right away why that was (I had been so on edge from all of the stress that my friends said hanging out with me felt like a ticking time bomb) and apologized. Before I knew I was going to lose her, I genuinely regretted using her as an emotional dumping ground. She's so amazing and deserved so much more than that. She accepted my apology but said she was still feeling anxious and unsure, so we agreed to take a break and go on a date next month to ""start fresh"". As we were leaving/the conversation was ending, she was very flirtatious and joked with me that the next four weeks would be like extended foreplay.

Her issues: During that conversation she also disclosed some of her own issues & trauma. She said that past experiences from childhood make it hard for her to be physically affectionate with someone, and that she can't be the girlfriend I need right now because all she wants is physical space, while all I want is to cuddle and have physical affection. Though I believe her, I'm very confused why issues from her childhood trauma are coming up now but didn't come up when she was dating her ex of two years. 

The break-up: After not seeing each other for a week I asked her to go to lunch because I was really confused about what was happening between us. She had been kind of flakey with answering messages at times, but at other times would blow up my phone. I had a weird feeling about everything and just wanted to talk. She basically said that whenever she's around me she feels anxious, and even though I ""check off all of her boxes"", she loves me, and she can see herself marrying me one day, she can't be with me right now. She said she really wants to be friends and ideally would want to try dating again in a few months (maybe once I'm graduated and things are settled down) but that she needs more time than one month and isn't sure when she'll be ready. She said she needs work on her own mental health/anxiety. She told me that she won't ask me to wait for her, because it's not fair to me. I tried to be understanding, and we ended up just chatting and joking around after the break-up.

As we were leaving the restaurant she made a small comment about me going on Tinder. I told her I didn't have to go on Tinder, and reminded her that she was the one ending things. She got awkward, and said she was ""just joking to deal with the jealousy"". I told her I didn't mind waiting for her and she told me not to wait. She said she wanted me to be happy, even if that meant seeing someone else, but that she just hopes we can be friends.

Once we were apart she sent me some snapchats but I didn't answer. I haven't heard from her since.

I'm completely broken over this. She was my first love, and I'm convinced I'll never find someone as perfect for me as her. Her friendship played a huge role in my life for three years, and I honestly feel like I've lost the best part of my life. I want her back more than anything in the world right now, even though the rational part of me is saying I need to move on in order to avoid being hurt.

7p945u,"Long story short. I met my girlfriend on OKCupid. We are still together for what is now 7 months. Summer was great. I didn't want it to end. Sex was amazing, every moment was amazing. We made it official in August. We expressed our love for one another fast. It was amazing. We already had so many. September rolls around and she is on her way to attend an Academy to be a Court Officer. In preparation, I take her everywhere she needs. What they asked of her is ridiculous. I did it because at this point I know I love this girl. She loves me, communication is there. She asks me to drive her the school. She needed me. I said yes. It was a stretch of 4 months, 4 trips a week, 2 days Friday and Sunday going and coming. It was hard on me. I let her know it but I also let her know I do it because I love her. She seemed to have an issue with me expressing myself.
With stress from the school directly into the job itself she became distant. Less and less texting, feeling no need to communicate, moments of depression which she suffers from, low self esteem, her mom becoming ill and needing hip replacement at age 74 and not doing well following the surgery. We got into an argument over it because what once was, isn't anymore. I asked if there was another guy, attraction issues. No. She tells me she is in love with me but sees no future with me. This comment blew my mind. It's illogical. I felt it was said in anger. She reached out to me the very next day because I felt she knew what she said was wrong. Following the fight, we see each other for dinner that same weekend. Things are normal. Christmas comes, she spends time with her mom after surgery, I understood, things were normal. We love each other. Cuddling, kissing, hugging. 

New Years comes, I check on her and her mom. Ask if she needs anything after being up all night...she snaps on me for things I said in December. She don't want me to do anything because what i said about the driving taking a toll on me hurt her. She said she didn't like that I expressed I go above and beyond for her. She found that to be tacky and pathetic. I didn't mean it that way, I was just worried about having some level of appreciation which I was not feeling. I don't see her for New Years. She ignores me without texting me at midnight. I hear from her the following night and she told me she is in her own world. She proceeded to ignore me the next 4 days. Got in touch with me last Friday. Asked about me and my parents. Told me about work and her mom. How stressed, tired and overwhelmed she is. Again she expresses how she doesn't want to talk to anyone. Its literally go top work, straight to her mom, home to sleep and all over again all week. Spends all her time doing laundry and sleeping and time with her mom on the weekend. I tell her I was worried, and right back to ignoring again right to today. I haven't heard back from Friday BUT I see her liking BUT not commenting on Facebook posts. She has her phone on her, She is on social media but can't text me back? I decided to write her a beautiful card expressing how the distance is killing me and how I want nothing more than to be apart of her world. My heart is dying to reach out.

7omiu8,"Okay so this is my first post on any forum, any discussion, any anything. I need help.

Background info - sorry it's so long:

I've been with my boyfriend for 3 years. The first year was a really rocky time, we met working together in a bar and through the process of figuring out we lived close, started to see each other outside of work. I had a close male friend who I stupidly introduced him to as my 'brother' when they first met because I was an idiot. Male friend then stayed over as we had been doing with each other for years before. My boyfriend (we had only just started to see each other at this point) flipped when he found out we were not related and was convinced we slept together which we did not. I then proceeded to cut all ties with my friend because that was what he wanted.

Few months later, my best best friend was having her birthday party in our bar. Me and my boyfriend had argued that day, so he was pissed. He treated my friends badly all evening. She then - without my knowledge - wrote a huge complaint about him to our managers. He then lost his promotion because of that. Me and my best friend fell out. We didn't speak for a while - all my fault through being weak - until her wedding that autumn at which I was one of her bridesmaids. The weekend before, my boyfriend had been at my place and my best friends fiancé was there, drunk. He said a few drunken things and my boyfriend punched him in the neck. We agreed to not tell my friend until after the wedding. The wedding for me was horrendous with many of my previous best friends in the know. When my best friend found out after, she called me in a rage - understandably - and we didn't speak again for a long time.

I was weak. We were still working together and I got back with this guy. My friends kicked me out of my house and we moved in together - because he was having a few issues with his landlord it was a move for convenience rather than for love.

I cut all ties with all of my precious friends for him because he felt betrayed if I would speak to them. My best friend tried a few times to make up but I ignored her. I ignored her. I ignored her completely for him.

We've lived together 2 years now. We've had countless fights. I feel like I'm always to blame. Nothing is good enough. But at the same time he opened up to me and I saw all his sides, his weaknesses and his loyalties and his fun and his charisma and his passion for life. But we stopped going out. We never went out on dates or anything. His reason was that he would rather save money and stay home where he can smoke than pay for any expensive experiences. I managed to convince him to go on holiday with me for a week but he's always thrown it back in my face that he would rather have gone home (he's Spanish), saved the money, got a new tattoo etc.

Now. I love to paint but I have in my life had a complete lack of motivation or energy. I started doing an evening course which I loved. I started to think about what I want to do in my life. I started to think about living abroad a little time, experiencing something new. I'm sick of London. My job is fast becoming a battleground between managers and staff. I want something different. I want to travel and get away for a while.

My boyfriend lost his job at that bar. He was fired. He then got another job in a different bar and was fired. He then didn't work for 6 months, spent all his money. He then got a builders card (he had been a builder in Spain) and started looking for work. He hasn't had much luck. He's in a dire financial situation.

I'm not happy with my life right now. I've found a few amazing looking art courses in Madrid and because I've been going to Spain every year my life and can speak a very little Spanish, I feel like this is something I now have my heart set on. I can learn a language! I can travel! I can leave London.

7p60tc,"Hello Reddit, so after dating for a month and a half of being in a relationship I've decided I want to break up with my girlfriend. Note that she is my first girlfriend since I've started getting into the dating scene and she had only one horrible boyfriend which she didn't like.

I've sat down and made a likes and dislikes to really put down into words what I liked in her and disliked about her.

She's really friendly, loyal, can be considerate, has a nice desire for sexual/intimate stuff (we didn't have sex, I held off on it for mine and her sake. Cause of the chemistry of what sex does to women and all), has a sense of humor, can be communicative, and overall a very good personality.

What I didn't like about her is how she's immature at times, dependent, doesn't know what she wants to do in life; kind of existing and enduring college, and I find her somewhat physically attractive.

At some point before actually dating I thought personality is something that's the most important. After dating her, I found out it was really something important to have in a partner. I'd love to find someone with just as great or better personality like hers. But physical attractiveness was more important than I thought. I was really shocked. Despite getting heated sometimes, I don't get that much turned on. I've come to the conclusion that I should just be friends with her (if she permits and is okay with it) and continue trying to find someone else. We're in a pretty happy relationship right now though. According to her, I'm a really good boyfriend and I can say the same of her. Even though it's hard to do, I think I need to move on. That's my case.

I know how I plan to do it but how do I talk about it?? (Obviously I won't read off my list of likes and dislikes)

On to the break up, in a few days I'm planning to invite her to starbucks and share a coffee with her. I'll have written a letter to give to her. The letter is to repeat what I wanted to say for later so that she can read in case she has any misunderstandings or if I don't communicate it well.

I don't know how to word my reasons to break up though. Obviously I don't want to say the reason is because of her physical appearance. Should I say I only see her as a friend but nothing greater than that? Whatever the reason is, I plan to include how great of a girlfriend she has been to me and how it's not her fault for the break up because it really isn't.

Hopefully she'll take it okay! Anyways that's my situation.

I met Sebastian [27M] in January 2017 and we dated briefly. I ended up breaking it off with him because he was being pushy about committing and about not using condoms. I had just recently left a very abusive marriage and wasn't ready for a serious relationship nor did I appreciate having my boundaries pushed. Shortly after that, he became involved with Brianna [32 F]. I observed their relationship from a distance via Instagram. They seemed happy and I didn't think much of it.

In September, Sebastian contacted me again. We caught up briefly and then he asked me to join him for some champagne in a hot tub. My first question was, ""Don't you have a girlfriend?"" to which he replied that they had broken up. We met for drinks and he gave a heartfelt apology for having pressured me. Slowly, we began seeing more of each other and the relationship turned physical.

We both live in the Pacific Northwest, but he's going to be moving to his hometown in the southeast at the end of this month. I'm moving to the southwest next month. I knew our relationship had an expiration date, even though he'd sometimes mention wanting to move to the city I'm going to, or have me move to his hometown. In our last encounter, he started pressuring me again to let him take the condom off. Again, I declined but recognized the red flag. 

The final straw was two weeks ago. He was supposed to come over but didn't. No call, no text, no response to my messages. For a week. I was hurt and confused. I gave him the benefit of the doubt and even considered that maybe something had happened to him, so I decided to google him. 

That's when I found their page on The Knot. They're planning on getting married this fall. A little more research lead me to a Facebook post from her sister that they had gotten engaged in October, when Sebastian was still actively pursuing me (we became physical in November). Brianna lives in his hometown- he was there seeing her during the week he had ghosted me. I imagine part of the reason he wasn't responsive to my messages was because he had blocked me while he was with her. When I confronted him about his behavior, he said that I was trying to keep him from his family, which really set me off.

We were going to have a face-to-face conversation during which time I was going to bring up the engagement to gauge his reaction but I broke it off with before we met, saying simply that it wasn't healthy for me to continue to see him. He doesn't know that I know he's engaged and I don't intend for him to find out.

My dad cheated on my mom and that was effectively the end of their marriage. I would never knowingly sleep with someone who was in a relationship, and I imagine he knows that which is why he kept it from me. I feel disgusted and betrayed, but more than anything, I'm very angry for his fiancee. I'm absolutely going to tell her, I'm just not sure how. Whether she chooses to go through with the wedding is her choice, I'm not trying to force her hand into leaving him, but I think she deserves to know what happened so she can make an informed decision. I want to wait until the end of this month once he returns home in order to protect myself from any possible retaliation. None of us in this situation are on social media but I paid $3 for her contact info on Spokeo. Should I call her? Email her? She lives in his hometown, so an in-person meeting is not possible, nor do I think it would be wise. Should I do it anonymously? Should I provide screen shots of our conversations right off the bat, or wait and see if she requests it?

7t7eum,"We live seperately in houses but both with roommates. I have 1 roommate.  My roommate is a professional, works business hours, keeps her home very clean. We have a weekly rotating chore list. We split the cost of cleaning supplies, and if we get behind on our chore we gently remind the other person. As a result the house is always generally tidy and clean. I grew up with a mother who demanded the floors be swept and mopped 4x/day, a load of laundry done everyday, the bathrooms cleaned 2x/week. She'd wake me up at 2am to clean the kitchen for 6yrs. It was overboard but everything was generally clean. 

My bf lives in a house with 4 roommates and a cat. 2 live in the basement, 2 have rooms upstairs, his room is next to the living room. He has a small powder room on the main floor and showers upstairs in the main bathroom that is shared with one of the roommates (the other one has the master bed+ensuite). The ages are 25-55yo men. Yet the house is never really clean. No one really takes the time to vacuum or mop, clean the cat litter, sanitize the kitchen. Apparently when the live in landlord was there she used to do everything. Now that she's gone (passed away 2yrs ago), no one made a chore list. 

I can almost forgive this (except about the cat!). Everyone generally clears whatever they were doing so it's *tidy* but not *clean*. BF's bathroom is neither of those things. Brown ring in the toilet, beard hair in the sink, toothpaste splatter in the mirror, dirty floor. I've told him many times his bathroom alone makes me uncomfortable and to please clean it. He keeps telling me he will. The next week I come over and it's really no different. I've resorted to buying slippers to wear at his place and a big bottle of purrell on his nightstand. His room has a ton of dust and he seemingly enjoys hoarding empty containers of food packages. 

8mos ago I begged him to at least buy a box of kleenex at the dollar store so we can properly clean up after sexy times. He didn't.  I've been bringing him a box every month. 

6mos ago I bought him handsoap when I got fed up of purrelling my hands every time I used the bathroom. When it ran out he didn't buy more until I got annoyed and bought a big refill jug. 

1mo ago I bought him cleaning supplies. Actual solutions and some cloths plus some lysol wipes. I explicitly told him what it was for. Passive agressive, I know but he couldn't complain he didn't have the funds to buy it now. Its still shrinkwrapped in the bag in a corner of his room. 

We both work shitty part time minimum wage jobs. I'm in school, he's not. I'm financially supported by my parents until this summer when I'm done school. He has no support. I get that it's hard since sometimes after bills and rent he only has $20 that week for food. But ffs go to the dollar store and buy a small bottle of  bleach at least!!! Matter of fact I bought everything already so there's no excuse anymore!! 

He's been begging me to move in with him but I haven't completely told him why I keep refusing (the cleaning is one reason, finances are another). We are now in the talks of moving in a new apartment together this fall. I want to take our relationship to the next level but I can't live like that for the rest of my life.

6kuwt1,"Hello Reddit, I did not know where else to ask, but basically in my current situation I will be a homeless 20 y/o in FL for a year. If you guys could help me answer a few questions it would be extremely helpful.

Some backstory:

 
   I am a 20 y/o college junior attending a very pricey private university. In order to go to college, my father helped me take out a loan for my first two years. Recently, I received a call saying my father's credit is not good enough to take out the loan. As a result, I am 60+ thousand dollars in student debt and after exerting all the effort and resources I have at my disposal, I have no way of continuing school. I have decided that in order to pay my dad back and finish school, I will join the military. Don't get me wrong, I have thought about joining the service for some time now. I would love to serve my country and gain the knowledge and experience of being a trained soldier. I just thought I would finish school first, but I guess life has other plans.

This is where surviving one year comes in. I was prescribed adderall my freshman year and have been using it as needed to focus on my studies. The military will not allow me to join while I am prescribed. So I have to submit a doctors note saying I am no longer prescribed, AND I must wait an entire year to meet the Marine Corp's qualifications. As a result of me essentially ""dropping out of school"" as my mom says, she is extremely disappointed and does not care for my circumstances (we do not get along; constant fighting and shouting at each other for as long as I've known her). She told me yesterday that if I don't continue school she will not have me home and all my lifelines cutoff. This includes my cellphone service and my car, the two things that would make this situation A LOT easier for me to workout. My father is in Minnesota and I have been living with my super-strict authoritative hardcore-catholic mother down here in Florida. She cannot help me with the loan either since she is helping my younger brother already.

I want to help myself because I know that no one else will. I have a retail job but it is 30miles away on the coast and without a car its kinda hopeless. If possible I don't want to involve my friends, this is my problem and as an adult I will deal with it as best I can. As for transportation I will not mind biking everywhere, I will longboard or walk if I have to. And as for my communication, I will have access to the wifi through my laptop and I am fairly tech savvy so I will figure that out someway somehow. If things go well then I will let you guys know! Wish me luck!

A few questions:


1. I will have a travel backpack, what essentials should I carry with me?

2. Saw online that I should get a gym membership at the YMCA for showers, water, and wifi. What do you guys think?

3. My student debt was set up so if I am not a full-time student I must start paying it back within 6 months. What should I do about this? Is there anyway to work out a deal with the military to help me out somehow?

4. If i am missing anything important let me know, this situation is new to me and I would like to overcome it best I can.

7nyrn8,"Hello, I am not sure if this is the right place to post this, so sorry in advance if it's not. I don't know how to begin, as the tittle states I have some pretty bad intimacy issues. And now I have ruined many relationships, right now I have just broken up with someone I love because of these fears. I guess my background would be a good place to start. 

My father was very emotionally and verbally abusive. I have this memory of him that sticks with me. I was young, probably 7, and he was trying to leave for work. I playfully grabbed his keys and began to run around the house. I wanted to play, I wanted him to catch me. I turn around by the front door and dangled his keys and said something like "" try to grab it!"" and I giggled. He stomped towards me, mocked my laugh with an angry face and ripped the keys from my hands. He grabbed me by the top of my shirt and looked me in my eyes and said ""Stop playing these stupid F*CKING games"". 
That was my childhood. He'd abuse me and my brother. Cheated on my mom more times than I can count. I never saw them even kiss. We had three wonderful dogs and he threw a vacuum at them from the top of the stairs when one of them peed. I cried and he told me to shut up. He later gave them all away while i was at school to spite my mother when they were divorcing. 
He drove my mother to drink. I love my mother, but I can't drink because it triggers me. There is nothing like seeing your mom passed out drunk on the floor as a child, laying in her vomit, crying out that she hates her life.
I barely have a relationship with him. He has scarred me in more ways than I want to admit.  

Also was in a horrible relationship with someone for five years who was also an addict and abused me in many ways.

This may sound horrid, but I guess it's safe to say I dislike men. I don't feel safe around them. I think they will only use me for sex, lie, or abuse me. It has isolated me from the world in many ways. I simply could not open up while dating someone. Have refused to have sex due to fear.
I know this is an unfair statement to say. But i have never known anything else until I opened myself up to ""him""

We will call him S. S sat next to me in a college class. And we talked. Now not to sound conceited but I am quite attractive, and am use to getting hit on and talked to pretty much wherever I go. But S was different. He never hit on me, never made a pass. He was shy, smart, and very polite. We were friends for months. I told him once how i loved swedish fish and the next week he brought me some to class. I was smitten, and felt things i had never really felt before. We finally kissed and he expressed how he had strong feelings for me so we began our relationship. 

This is where all hell broke loose.

I had no idea what it meant to be in a relationship. I didn't know how to communicate without being passive aggressive. I would insult him and become enraged over the smallest things. I have broken up with him more times than i can count. I pull away after sex. Granted he isn't perfect either, but i feel i have brought out the worse in him.
I have destroyed our relationship. 
And apparently last night was the last straw. I broke up with him for a petty reason and haven't heard from him since.

I know this behavior is wrong. I know it. I am no good for anybody and am basically damaged goods with daddy issues. I have never spoken about my past with anyone really, except for him. 

I just want to know how to change? How do I unlearn this behavior. I don't have much money and not many friends due to the way I isolate myself. So who do I go to, how do i trust men? I know this is a loaded question. But I am so depressed.

Also, If S does come back. How can i start making changes for our relationship?

7o83xh,"Hi there, long time lurker here. I've been looking at this subreddit since my ex, lets call her L, broke up with me mid July of 2017. This may be a long post so buckle up. Basically, I want some second opinions about maybe salvaging the friendship I had with my ex before we dated and or seeing what you guys think about how I handled the whole thing. So here goes nothing.  

Back in November of 2015, my Junior year of college, I was a hermit socially but had many great and supportive friends (funnily enough were 90% women). However, I was lonely as hell, had never dated, and it was driving me mad and depressing me. I didn't let it show though, except to one or two friends who knew me very well. In the month of november I started hanging out with an organic chemistry study group. Two particular women were part of this group. L was among them but so was another women, lets call her M. M was shy like me, but also fun (or at least I thought so at the time ). Fast forward a few weeks into the month of November 2015, I was feeling especially lonely on a friday night so I sent M a snap chat, asking if she wanted to share some liquer I had just bought. She surprisingly said yes. One thing led to another, and we end up making out (I thought fucking finally!! Maybe I was datable), only going so far as me fingering her for a while but her not touching me (maybe this was a red flag but Im not sure). 

Fast forward months, M and I grew much closer but there were issues. One, she abused me. Used me to do homework for her. Would ""play"" yell at me if I was being slow or didnt like what I was doing. Two, she would never do anything for me socially or personally, it was always about her. Fast forward to February, despite it all, I told her we couldnt continue what was happening between us unless we made it official. So after a somewhat nice date, I asked her and we became official (woo first girlfriend I thought!). 

BUt it only got worse, she became clingy, emotionally abusive, verbally abusive, and an all around asswhole to me. Come late august 2016, she broke up with me over the phone (for stupid reasons I can't remember). Once I was back at school, my friends comforted me and talked me out of a depression following the breakup. I got over pretty fast I'd reckon. She used me, plain and simple.


Now take all of this into context, back to L. When I had initially started hanging out with the orgo study group with both L and M in it, I had initially noticed L. She was astonishing beautiful, funny, and gentle. I didnt think I stood a chance with her. Yet she crossed my mind alot even though I was with M not 6 months later. Anyway, I discovered after the breakup with M that L had always liked me as I did her. But only after months of me hanging out with her and helping her through her relatiobnship issues with someone who was an ass to her (all of this following the breakup with M). It was now Nov 2016. M was far gone from my mind, and L was solely the woman I wanted. 

I had helped her recover from the break up she'd gone through and we had developed an incredibly close bond. We did homework together, wrestled, talked about emotions, watched American horror story (Roanoke season, bah didnt end like I wanted it to), etc etc. You see the point. Keep in mind that I was still a virgin even after dating M. I can answer why if people want me to after I finish droning on story. 

Anyway, one night L and I were sitting in her room, and she started a realy intense wrestling match. Im a big guy, I work out, and she somehow pinned me an unbelieavable strong choke hold. I could not escape. So i did the only thing I could do, not chicken out. I stood up, sat on her, and pinned her right back to the floor. But there was a pause, our faces were extremely close now. I wanted to kiss her so bad, and turns out, so did she (she told me later). I didnt though. But I wouldnt let this dissuade me. One week later, on the dot, I kissed her. 

And it was FUCKING MAGICAL!!! I felt the SPARKLE!!! gahhh, just thinking about it is really sadening to me... Anyway, we made out, you can guess what happened next.. (no sex though). Fast forward a few weeks, we became inseperable and everyone, I MEAN EVERYONE, of our friends, jumped for joy when they discovered L and I decided to start dating. My god it felt magical to be dating her... God I miss that feeling. bah. 

Anyway, couple months down the line, I met her family, loved them, they loved me (they're first impression of me was, get this, me clogging they're toileting and it overflowing with me yelling SOS through the bathroom door.. it was awesome lol). L and I continued to grow even closer as my now senior year progressed (her junior). Then March happened. L started to act wierd. Would constantly tell me she didnt deserve me, how I deserved someone better, she didnt know how she got me... etc... 

This continued through the entirety of March 2017. The last wednesday of March, I got up early in order to visit her apartment to cheer her up before I went to class. She was in the shower, so I waited in her room. On her bed was her phone, unlocked. Curious, just because thats how I am, I picked it up... Open was facebook messenger, with the most recent facebook messenger sent 10 minutes earlier.. to a guy labeled Sexy Security Gaurd... I scrolled through as much as I could, not believing what I was seeing... 

For the entirety of the month of march... she had been recieving messages from a coworker.. (I will not say where she worked)... discussing how he was going to have sex with her, when and where, how he was gonna visit her, dick pics, etc etc.. (you get the idea). To L's credit, she did not send back any pictures (i only went back 1.5 weeks in messages, so I can't be entirely sure), and she did occasionally tell him ""no"" or ""thats inappropriate"". The thing was though, that morning, the messages had not been started by this guy, it had been L, with the message ""I wish I had woken up to you""........... I was to shocked to do anything, I just sat there.. I locked her phone and waited for her to get out of the shower... she came back in... I told her I saw the messages... she knew exactly what was going on... 

I told her how I had come to cheer her up, and to give her a morning kiss (stop, no rolling eyes, I'm affectionate occasionally like that). And that I had discovered this... She just stood there, closed the door... and didn't really say anything... I'll spare you the details, but we spent the whole day trying to work out what the FUCK i just read. 

Basically her excuse boiled down this: He's a coworker I work with alot, if I had cut him off, I would have lost him as a friend. She told me she was sorry and that she didn't know how and when to tell me that this guy was messaging her and what the hell he was sending her.. but I trusted her, she could have told me and we could have solved the issue together. In the end, after a lot of crying... I forgave her.. but my trust was significantly damaged... 

Fast forward to May 2017, I graduated. I never felt so proud, L was standing there with me and I was on top of the world. I still didn't trust L as much as I used to, but things were good. then came June. You see, L is in a 3+2 PA program.. Starting early June, she had reading homework every week. Combine that with the fact that she started to work 70+ hours a week, every week, she understandably got stressed. 

I worked as a landscaper this summer while she worked (I will not say what she did for work). I worked around 38-45 hrs a week, so I had freetime but I was very understanding and supportive of L's work and schedule. We would schedule time to see each other once every 2 weeks. Sometimes one a week on the weekend. This worked greated. Until late june. 

She started to cancel my visits to see her. Asking if I was mad, when I constantly told her I supported everything she needed to do to succeed. (I really did). If she needed space to do homework, thats perfectly fine. I did my best to assuage her anxiety. So we'd postpone another week, another day... only, either the night before or the morning of, she'd cancel me visiting again... again.. and again... 

That put a little strain on our relationship, we wanted to see each other. Early July, we went to NYC together to celebrate her roommates birthday.... The night before we left, I had told her my mom, (a very traditional parent), had kept telling me L was obviously losing interest and not trying in the relationship. This really upset her. So much so that when I went to pick her up to drive to her roommates house to pack everyone in the car to go NYC (2 hour drive i might add), she told me this: ""I don't know if I can maintain a relationship anymore"".... I heart sank... farther than I thought possible. and for 2 hours we didn't speak. And for the 3 hours to NYC from where we met her roommates, she refused any contact with me.. wouldn't hold hands with me, would brush away cuddling in the backseat on the long drive.. wouldn't even really talk to me or look at me... Despite all this I really did try to have fun while in NYC, at least to give her roommate a fun birthday. But things only got worse. 

L refused to let me get clothing for her at the MANY clothing stores we went to, refused to let me get drinks for her when we went bar hopping... got mad at me for stupid reasons... wouldn't hold hands with me while walking around NYC... you get the picture. The last night we were in NYC, I won her a giant pikachu at a bar game.. That seemed to cheer her up, as she suddenly started being a little affectionate.. it didn't last long as she soon after started snapping at me. The morning we left to go to her parents house (we had previously agreed I was going to spend the night with her there for cuddles and movies), I had asked her if I could visit her once a month once her didactic PA year started in full.. and she freaked out on me and withdrew once more. So i dropped it. Once we got to her parents house, we sat outside on the porch laughing and having fun with her family until suddenly she started to get really withdrawn, stressed, angry, and annoyed. 

She obviously didn't want me there. So i offered to just leave so she could study, and she accepted. As I was leaving, she got in the car with me, just to say good bye. She didn't wanna kiss per the usually, she just got out, didnt say much, and I left. Two hours later when I was home, she sent me a barrage of texts saying how much she loved, and so on. (Note: I waited for her to say the LOVE word first, and she did on my birthday). The distance continued however... things werent any better. 

One week later, mid July... I called her around 11:00pm, as we would 2-3 times a week talk on the phone while she drove home from work around 9pm. I was a little confused why didn't call me though so I called her.. she seemed more stressed than the previous days so I was asked what was on her mind... She refused. But then a couple minutes later broke up with, over the phone.... I was heart broken... a mess. a piece of rubble. I loved this girl with all my heart. I didn't know what was going on. She gave me every generic excuse as to why she wanted the relationship to end, including thinking of other guys, being over the relationship, being to busy, not being able to give me what I want (really?), her rough childhood (and this applies to me how?), not loving me anymore (not being sure if she actually loved me in the first place), etc..... 

Anyway.. I didn't beg, I just poured my heart and soul out to her asking her to reconsider. She did not even though she admitted I did nothing to merit this. She promised me we would meet up a week later and make arrangements to just be friends. That never happened. She freaked out on me the night before because she was ""stressed"".. So i just gave up. I stopped responding to her texts. She texted a friend of mine, I'll call him B, alot to complain and ask why I wasn't responding, how she still wanted me in her life, etc... I didn't respond for a few days.. She became quite clingy the more I didn't respond, always asking me how I was doing, how she was srry... stuff like that. I responded about 3 days later. By this point I just gave up entirely. 

Over the month that followed she'd constantly text me asking how I was doing. I wouldn't really respond. By the time mid august came around she sent me a message basically saying: Im gonna give you lots of space now. I still very much loved this woman, maybe even a little now. But I didn't want her to throw all her problems on to me again. I was a wreck as it was. In the end, the day before her didactic classes were to begin, I left a box of wine for her and her roommates with some friends. I got one last text saying thank you for the wine, but I have not contacted her since. I only recently blocked her on everything save her phone number.

So there it is, quite a story, mind giving me some feedback and what the hell happened? Did I handle it wrong? Any advice? Any feedback? etc.. I could really use it, as I do miss her..

7pcnlw,"Ever since I was in middle school, I was always extremely bothered by how my parents treated each other, my sister, me, and the rest of both sides of the family. And now, living with only my mom due to a recent divorce, though I thought things would get better, they've only gotten much worse.

The first thing that I really started to notice is my dad's way of demanding respect. He's said that we, as his children/wife, need to treat him like a king. We need to vow to obey his command, no matter what that command may be. He even told me once that if he told me to kill myself, I, being his son, should do so in order to please him. He's done things like take musical instruments I payed for with my own money(I had a job at 15) and sell them so he can buy himself something. Any chance of defending myself from this got the ""Because you're a minor, you don't legally own anything, and being that it is in my house, I have the right to do this"" response. He's also told my sister that, because she's his daughter, he owns her. I remember cases of her needing to leave for school and him threatening to call the police and say she ran away because he wanted her to stay home(and sometimes even already called her out of school) so she can make him meals.(He didn't work so he was always home).


Another major thing I remember with my dad is him calling the police and lying that I threatened him with weapons, several times this happened, because of me disagreeing with him. He was a very ""My way or no way"" kind of person growing up. I've always felt lucky I didn't get a charge for any of these, mostly because the police never believed him though. The closest I came was when I was 18, I had already gotten my apartment and was packing to leave. He didn't want me to leave for some reason, so knowing I would have several knives in my pocket, he called them saying I threatened him at knife point. Lucky the only knife i had in my pocket(the others were in my backpack already in the car) was a small fishing line knife that I always carried for the purpose of using as a screwdriver, holding dead wires in guitars so I could solder them, etc. I honestly feel lucky to have never been in jail for him doing this.


My mother, on the other hand, is the kind of person who expects to be able to drop anyone, including her children, for the sake of herself. In the past, she's done things such as move all of my stuff outside with a note saying ""You can't live here"" despite me being a minor at the time. She's suggested I sell instruments(I needed them for school, I had a scholarship that required I stay in band through my then senior year and continue through college, which I lost thanks to them, which will be explained) or demand I give her entire paychecks because she spent all of her money going out with friends or wanted to buy some fancy thing she couldn't afford.


After I left graduated High School, I went straight into college. Because neither of my parents made enough money to support themselves, let alone me, while in my first year, I had to work two jobs to make the house payments and buy my own food. I had already planned on leaving at this point, but because I had to make these payments, could hardly afford to save enough money to get my own place. Once I did, they decided to move so they didn't have to feel financially responsible for me anymore(Their words) and moved out of state, which destroyed my chance at college as FL requires you either still be dependent on your parents or be independent for a year before you are eligible for in-state tuition. So, I got a warehouse job and lived out the year, still planning to go back into study. About a month before the year mark, something happened with my parents and they could no longer afford their new house, and were going to be homeless unless someone helped them. It was either me or no one at this point, as my sister had made it clear she wanted nothing to do with them. So, I moved back in with them and helped them make money by giving them all of the fin. aid extras that I got for the two semesters since. Because TN has a much better schooling system, I was able to get into school at least, which worked out because I could not ever have to be at the house.


This is where things just got worse though. My parents started fighting a lot, and I'm fairly certain my mom was having an affair as she constantly treated my dad like shit and would regularly mention her new friend who made well over six figures. After tormenting my dad for so long, he decided to get a divorce, caring so little about everything he left taking nothing with him. Eventually he made my mom pay his part of the house, and now I'm stuck with just my mom who walks around the house flirting with whoever that other guy is all of the time. She has said to me on several occasions since they got the divorce said I am ""just another one of her problems like my dad"" and has even said she wishes I would just vanish.


In order to at least have some privacy while I'm here, as I cannot risk having to drop out of school again, I have been putting all of my extra money into rebuilding a large room of our house in order to have ""my own place,"" a room that would have a lock and all so it's like we live in a stacked duplex. She was fine with it, but has made comments about ""I can't wait to feel like I don't live with you anymore,"" which only makes me want to get the room done faster. Though the challenge is, after two semesters of dumping fin. aid extras into this room, leaving furniture and other stuff in the room, I find that a lot of stuff was missing. I guess someone she works with needed furniture so she sold it to her. My furniture. That I paid for. She then goes bragging about how she just bought two fancy tables for her crafts room that she never even uses, totaling well over $500. This is someone who claims she cannot afford to put food in the fridge.


Now that my dad lives elsewhere, he's also been super-guilt tripping both my sister and me. He constantly spams my phone complaining about how terrible his life is now(now that he doesn't have anyone to do everything for him) and that he can't even find the strength to eat. He's done things like send my sister(Who makes more than my parents ever did combined) pictures of money saying if she comes to visit, he will pay her. He's done similar with me, saying he will help me buy a new car if I go to see him, he's called and left voicemails complaining about how bad is apartment is(He had never lived in anything except a full home before, moving from his parents' to the house his dad built for him) and just in general is trying to make my sister and me feel bad about the divorce.

7pbdz5,"My husband and I went on a cruise. I paid for the vacation as a surprise gift to him and got us both the unlimited alcohol option. Neither of us drink very often, we have a drink maybe every 6 months and I have never seen him drunk. The first night we both got plastered and had a great time. We enjoyed the other activities on the cruise and were really enjoying ourselves. The last night my husband drank a lot again and I didn’t care initially until I got a massive headache and he was being super obnoxious, disturbing other guests, etc. He is a HUGE guy and impossible to make do anything he doesn’t want to and I was having a hard time trying to control him.

 He would not listen to me or slow down at all drinking and I was getting super frustrated. I admittedly lost my cool and told him he was being an asshole and that I wanted to go back to the room to change for dinner, if he didn’t come then that’s his choice. I left him at the bar (we had friends around and we are on a cruise ship so it wasn’t like he was absolutely alone or going to be hurt or lost or something) and went to change/shower for dinner. Long story short he got completely hurt by this and said I abandoned him, was drunk crying, wouldn’t talk to me, etc. I kept trying to talk to him but he started getting pissed, called me worthless, a dumbass, I wasn’t shit before I met him, etc etc. He has NEVER talked to me like this before and I was super shocked and hurt. I have major self esteem issues anyway so how he was talking was really hurting me and making me feel horrible. Eventually I gave up, went to the front desk and cut off the alcohol for him and went to our room to sleep. I slept on the couch and about 3 hours later he finally showed up and passed out on the bed. 

The next morning we drove home (12 hr drive) and spent atleast 6 hours talking about the night before and me crying and telling him how hurt I was. He apologized a lot, told me he was drunk and didn’t mean the things he said, told me he should have never drank that much and wouldn’t do it again, etc. He told me it was no excuse for his actions but in his drunken state he felt like I had walked out on our relationship and left him forever. 

Our relationship is pretty much perfect besides this. He has been my best friend since the first day we met, he treats me great, he is always loving, not at all selfish, etc. We rarely fight and have only had maybe 2 other big arguments which we worked out. I am just so hurt over what he said to me. 

Do I just let it go and move forward with his apology? Like I said, it’s  not like either of us ever drink and the only reason we made it a point to drink so much was because I spent so much on the alcohol package for vacation. 

Do we need to go to counciling? This only happened 2 days ago so the wounds are fresh but I don’t know if we should talk to someone or something.

7nhkfr,"Throwaway because she reddits. Also, sorry for my mistakes, English is not my first language.

So, I fucked up. Like, REALLY fucked up.

Basically, I’ve been together with my current girlfriend for 7 months or so now. We are both very stubborn so fights are normal for us - most of the time they’re nothing serious and we make up immediately after. We also jokingly insult each other’s all the time, no big deal.

Yesterday night we started bickering like usual, over something incredibly stupid but whatever, our “fight” was light-hearted and we didn’t mean no harm. The problem was - I had a very, VERY shitty day so I was feeling extremely annoyed and nervous. I know this isn’t an excuse, but bear with me. So things started to escalate & I ended up saying some very mean things to her. Like, “picking on your insecurities” level of mean. I’m not proud of it, at all.

I regretted my words immediately after I shouted them. She immediately closed her mouth and just stared at me with disbelief and hurt in her eyes like she couldn’t believe I just said that. I could not believe it, either. But like I said, I’m a fucking stubborn piece of shit so I didn’t even tried to apologize. We stared at each other’s in an awkward silence for a while, then she just said “I need to go to the bathroom” and she left me to think about what I had just done and drown in shame.
Anyway, 5, 10, 15 minutes pass, no sign of life by her and I’m feeling more and more regretful every second that passes. I decide to go to check on her, but the door of the bathroom is locked. I put my ear against it and I hear her sobbing.

I felt so bad I almost started crying right there. My girlfriend is very emotional but rarely lets herself cry in front of others, she always bottles everything up and then lets go when she’s alone. I can’t believe I seriously made her cry, I felt (and still feel) horribly guilty. I love her very much. So I knocked and told her to please let me in. She refused, I told her I was sorry and I didn’t mean any of the things I said and that I love her very much. She said to go away so I did (we were at her house).

Now a whole day passed and she still refuses to talk to me :( I’m worried, guilty and just want to hug her and tell her again that I’m sorry. I sent her some messages but she ignored them. I know I fucked up and she has every right to be mad at me since I said some really bad things but I feel so bad. I just want to reassure her that I didn’t mean any of it. I feel like an asshole who just kicked a puppy. She didn’t deserve any of the things I said and did.

What should I do? Should I give her some more space and let her come to me? Should I apologize again? I love her a lot and I don’t wanna lose her over a stupid fight in which I couldn’t keep my stupid mouth shut.

7pqqrs,"Been together for 5 years, married for 1 year. My husband outwardly reserved/introverted but he's also very goofy around me. We joke around and are playful with each other in most interactions unless it comes to serious subjects. Lots of teasing, tickling, and 'play wrestling' in our home. 

The problem has always been when it comes to, umm, being romantic. We struggle in that category. I am very romantic by nature, so I send flirty texts, touch him, tell him what I want him to do to me, etc. Although I have no problem turning him on, the problem is when it comes to reciprocating. He deflects pretty much all my attempts to be sexy with him in some way or another. Flirty text? Respond with something comical. Sexy touching? He'll make sound effects when he grabs me certain places. Dirty talking in bed? Respond with something silly and not sexy. 

It makes me feel bad, like I'm not able to get through to him that I'm trying to share my desire for him and I'm vulnerable. It also kinda kills my buzz so to speak. I feel like I am always the one seducing and I just have a hard time getting turned on when I feel like he doesn't makes any attempt. He told me early on in our relationship that to him sex should be something we should be able to laugh at and shouldn't be some super serious thing. I'm not trying to make it 'super serious', I just kind of want to be aroused and it's hard to do that when he's on top of me and waggling his eyebrows like Groucho. 

I know it's hard for him to come out of his shell and be sexy, basically because he lacks the confidence. He finds it awkward and not really him. At the same time, I want him to take charge and try to actually turn me on without joking for once. I've never been able to cum with him in the entire duration of our relationship and I just feel like this might be a part of the problem; that I don't feel very romanced. 

I had this talk with him before and it didn't really change anything. Now lately I decided that I am going to stick to it, that if he doesn't take it seriously while we're getting 'amped up' for sex that I will just tell him that I'm suddenly not in the mood and tell him that he's being too goofy right now. Basically condition him against the bad habit.

Any other ideas? How do I communicate with him the way I want him to romance me if it's against his nature? Is it even possible? Should I just try to change myself?

81asft,"Where do I start, I'm stuck living with my parents for the time being, my dad being a narcissist.
He's of course not diagnosed though, cause he wouldn't ever visit a doctor because nothing's wrong with him, right? And then, prove it.


My dad has always been abusive to me and everyone else in the family. Physically, emotionally, mentally, pretty much every way imagineable. 
I have even been brought right next to the point of death at his hand when I was too young to physically defend myself.
I was on the bed, and I forget for what reason specifically, but I believe I dared to question his ultimate authority on some matter.
In an act of his so called discipline, he bent my legs backwards over my head and pushed me against the wall, hitting me as hard as he could, I remember that I couldn't even speak, simply motioning for help from my mom who happened to be in the hallway at the time.
If my mom had not intervened, I would likely have been choked to death as I was only about 10-12 at the time, being assaulted by this 50 y/old ""man"".

There have also been other been other accounts of assault one in which I was shoved into a mirror by him, another pushed into a wall.
I have taken up learning at least some basic self defense measures as a result of this, and constantly think when in a room with him what I could weaponize in the case of an attack. 

He has purposely targeted mainly my mom over the years, through abuse ranging from emotional to physical.
Often he will get in her face, or mine now, screaming derogatory insults for the sole intent of trying to get one of us to hit him, just so he can claim ""assault"" then thinking he has the upper hand and can force us into submission with the threat of jail over our heads.

I would always intervene on my mom's behalf and defend her with my life.
I have even gone so far as to document on camera incidents of assault which I keep under lock and key.

Many times I have urged my mom to file divorce, even offering myself to speak in her behalf as I have witnessed all the evils of this ""marriage"" that only serves as a servitude to his abuse. 
The main problem has always been that my younger brothers would likely be legally obligated to attend visitation in one form or another with him. 

I have seen what he will do in desperation, tearing phones out of the wall, shoving, pushing. And this is the mild version, I am sure he would stoop to far greater if we were to fall out of his control. 

So we sit trapped to his tyranny.

Lately though, as in the past couple years he has started to target me and my younger brothers..

He singles each of us out engaging in pointless arguments, only looking to make our lives hell.
Then later has the gull to rant how he wants the best for us, while screaming at the top of his lungs in our face after a series of cutting insults.
I'm sick of his derogative sociopathic tendencies. 

The only way you have a day of peace in the house is by not having him in the house.
I can only take so much, and yet there is nowhere I can go to escape this hell I am forced to live through every second of every day.
I have no job yet, or a drivers license because, guess what, the only way I can get a license is to drive alone, in a car with that narcissistic sociopath. For all I know, I'd end up dead on the side of the road. 

We can't afford drivers lessons with a normal human being, and my choosing such would only bring more harassment as in his little world he's the best driver there's ever been or ever will be.
Aaand since I can't really get a job, as I can't drive, I now get harassed about being lazy.

On top of that, I barely have any ability to get any money my own to make any sort of fund to get out of here.
I was never even able to have any hope of a bank account without it being joint to him so he could suck it dry until I reached age 18.

He's always been a loser his entire life, and constantly he has taken money from us kids... any money you get you better keep that info to yourself unless you want it stolen from you with a shallow promise of it being paid back someday.

Only when that someday comes that he has more than a bounty from child tax money he's scraped up, and maybe a couple cents from work, you'll be told something to the effect of ""what did you ever do to deserve it?"", or ""after how you treat me?"" It being the money you gave for god knows what reason. Likely because you are decent human being, one with feelings of sympathy, something's he fails to process. Well how about how you treat us kids? How about that?


No this isn't just some edgy teen, oh I hate my dad, I have every reason to hate him, for what he has done, and continues to purposely do to me and my family.
For nearly killing me, for scarring us all to the point I can't even meet a nice person, or have any friends, and not wonder whether they do or don't treat their family like a lump of sh.

Nobody needs, nor should they ever have to live the life I have been forced to live. Nobody should have to call the police because they don't feel safe within their own home. Nobody should have to walk on eggshells continuously wondering what's going to be the next trigger for a two week argument. Nobody should need to learn self defense for protection against another family member. 
Nobody.

Though it doesn't stop here, oh hell no, that's just the beginning of my newest insanity.
Now, after how I've stood up for my mom through all these years, in every way possible.
She repays me with utter deceit and repeatedly lays me into the hands of my narcissistic nemesis.

Repeating his words of deceit as if they are truth, as if he has changed. He's always been a narcissist, and guess the hell what? He's always going to be one.

Now it's not bad enough I have him harping on me all the time, nope, now I have to have my mom on my back to, supporting his false accusations and claims.

""You have to forgive and forget"". Newsflash, you've been doing that for the past 25 years mom, and where did that get you? Where did that get any of us? He has never given me any or anyone else any reason to be convinced he has / will / nor will ever have any intent to change whatsoever at any point in time. 
Oh, and I should just stay quiet and let him say his thing. Why should I have to?
I need him to tell me that everything I'm doing is wrong, simply just because it doesn't conform to his idea of what I should be doing? AKA kissing his a?

Don't think so.
Sorry to rant on like this. Maybe I am the problem, I don't know, in times like these... it's.. just hard to even know what the truth is anymore....
I just feel trapped, and at my breaking point... perhaps I just need to vent for now...
I'm just so tired of dealing with this nonsense and constantly being made out like I'm the problem just because I'm now an adult, so suddenly I'm to blame for the wreck that my life is.

All this, when nobody trained me in a job, nobody sat down and talked to me about what I'd like to do, and I've never had someone to comfortably express my true feelings to. 

Nobody at this point is even there to support me, and it's a constant uphill battle I can't win with no other way to go. 
At this point, only way I've seen out, I'm not going to sugar-coat it.. is to kill myself.
In the heat of these constant arguments with both my mom and dad now on my case, it's too much stress for me to take. There's only so much a person can handle before they are at their limits. I'm at my wits end at this point.
I'm just too much of a coward to kill myself, and that's one of the few reasons I'm even still around.

What hurts the most is that after all I have done for her, this is how she treats me... 
Favouring him who's done nothing but agonize her, against me.

I'm sure you got your own problems without worrying about me...

I feel like the times that we aren't fighting, he's just depressed and I am trying to make him feel better despite also being depressed. I don't feel like I have time to take care of myself because I try so hard to not only fix us but fix him as well because he won't fix himself. I know I shouldn't be trying to fix him and he should be trying to help himself but that is how things have been. 

I have constantly asked him to go to therapy with me or by himself, he always says he doesn't have time and says he will do it sometime in the future. He is starting a new job next week with better hours and is supposedly going to have more time to try these things then but honestly I don't feel like waiting anymore. I don't want to lose the relationship but I don't want to stay in this specific situation feeling drained and like I've lost myself. I've gotten to the point where all of the waiting has led to the breaking point and I miss feeling happiness. 

On top of this, I'm just beginning to think that maybe we aren't a good match. I could really use additional input on this because I'm not exactly sure what a healthy and compatible relationship looks like at this point. When we try to go out and do things, we often do not have fun because our personalities clash. 

Example of this, I wanted to go kayaking and was surprised that he said yes because he rarely wants to be outside. We get to the springs to kayak and I want to go in the water because I see no point in kayaking if you don't go in the water. He refuses because he hates water. I try to joke around with the paddles and he gets upset I am not taking it seriously. I like to have fun but feel like I cannot be myself and have fun when we do go out. We are very opposite in that way. 

At the moment I don't think I will end things and I will wait for this new job of his to start since it's so soon in the future, but I have made arrangements to move out if I decide I really want to and am still not sure if I actually should. I'm scared that if I tell him I need to move out and have space that things between us will come to an end. I've thoroughly expressed to him that I am unhappy, I feel unsupported, I feel like I can't be myself, feel drained, etc. but he says he is being himself and still trying but it's not enough for me so I should leave. I don't want to just leave, but I don't feel like he's working with me for an alternative so we can be happy and I can be too.

7sns1i,"OK, so as the title says my sister has been trying to set me up with her friend for a couple of months now. Up til recently I refused to even entertain the idea because she is slightly over a full decade younger than me.  My sister thinks I'm being stupid letting the age difference make my mind up for me, to the point where we had a huge fight at Christmas about it but I refused to budge. Recently however she's been bringing her friend around a lot (me, my sister, and her husband all get along really well so we hang out at least 2 or 3 weekends a month usually) and as I get to know this girl I am realizing why my sister has been so adamant about it.

It's almost eerie how much we have in common. Almost the exact humor, very similar interests, same exact political and religious views, etc.  She's pretty cute and apparently she thinks I am as well (which kind of makes me question her taste in men, but I digress).  We get along quite well and it's really easy to make each other laugh. It almost feels like one of those movies where a woman is sent to spy on a man so she learns all the perfect responses to whatever he says. 

So I'm definitely starting to open up to the idea of asking her out but the only thing stopping me is that age difference. I have no problem with a few years either way, hell the last girl I dated was 6 years younger, but this is an entire decade. That's a lot.  But other than the number itself I don't know if I should care this much or not.  She's pretty mature for her age and I'm admitedly a bit of a late bloomer so we are in roughly the same stage of life so that's not an issue like in a lot of age differential cases.  But I just can't help shake the thought of how weird it seems to me. Like, and I know this is a whole series of ""what ifs"", what if we connect, date, fall in love, the whole shebang.  If we were together long enough there will be a couple month period when I turn 40 and she's still in her 20s.  That's not a good thought to me, it makes me feel like a creeper just for the possibility.  I know that's a far cry from the ""trying to set up"" stage but it's still something in my head.

The other part that makes me feel weird about it as well is I asked my sister if she told her friend that she wanted to set us up and she told me no, that she wanted her to fall into it naturally and then me stepping and do all the leg work. First off that kind of annoys me because if you're gonna set someone up you should at least let both parties know you are trying. But second off that makes me feel even worse about the age difference because if I end up deciding to give it a shot I run the risk of looking like a creeper hitting on a girl 10 years younger than me seemingly out of the blue.

So I'm torn and don't know what to do. One one hand this girl is really awesome and damn near perfectly what I've been looking for, but on the other hand that age difference feels like too much.   So I don't know if I should pursue her and I feel like I need to make up my mind about it soon before I miss my window to try. So I guess my question is, am I being stupid by letting this bother me or was I right in the first place to dismiss it?",748,Q3,1,Sister wants me to ask out her friend who is 10 years younger than me.

7tqu5h,"Throwaway account and names have been changed but I was hoping I could have some advice for my situation.

It all began on New Years Eve this year (29 days ago) I had a hotel room that I shared with my sister [22 F] to party during the new in the next town over (better night life), my sister was staying out all night so I had the room to myself. Before going out to a party I invited a few friends round, my best friend Ben [17M] and two girls we're close friends with Kate [18F] and Jamie[17F]. Kate and Jamie are very important

I go to school with these three people and we are good friends, we were having pre-drinks before leaving for the party. Im going to be honest and straight up say I had/have a huge crush on Jamie and we have a little history together;

We have had multiple drunk hook ups (as teenagers do) and I once drove a 2 hour round trip to go see her one night when she was house sitting, she was drunk and I was sober and nothing apart from a bit of making out happened however I left feeling optimistic about our relationship, this was early December and was the night before I left to go on a sporting tour across the country so I couldn't drink or stay the night with her.
 
Back to New Years Eve; we arrived at our friends house where me and Ben took some MDMA (regular users) and split up leaving me alone with Kate[18F], Jamie[17F] and Bella[17F] another friend I occasionally flirt with (nothing too serious). We all decided we wanted to go to the party now (around 8pm I think). I was really hoping to bring Jamie back to my hotel room tonight and we were flirting more then we usually do. I pay for an uber for us all to go to the party and we arrived before any of our other friends but there was lots other people there already so we just chilled out and passed around a few joints. As soon as we arrived at the party Jamie[17F](my crush) and Kate[18F] began talking about these two boys they invited and were trying to get fucked by tonight, my mood instantly changed and I got really quite and I didnt really want to be there as soon as Jamie[17F] started mentioning another guy, Bella[17F] noticed this and was asking me what was wrong but I was starting to come up off the MDMA and I really didnt want to be there.

I have sort of a memory blank until I remember all of our other friends turning up to the party (maybe like 9:30pm). Everyone was just sitting around talking and smoking while the party began getting crowded. I got tired of listening to Kate[18F] and Jamie[17F] talking about these other guys arriving and I left to do some more MDMA and I began talking to a girl from our school that graduated this year, Sophie[18F], she was pretty drunk and smelled alot like weed and she was very talkative. Sophie is also VERY important to my situation

I sparked up another joint and we were sitting together after a breif introduction she started telling me everything about her after admitting it was her first time smoking weed. I smoke weed semi-regularly so I kept talking to her, and she ended up telling me she just broke up with her boyfriend of 6 months because he wanted to have sex with her and she wasnt ready yet.

This must have been around 10:30pm and I was Jamie talking to her guy friend that arrived at the party so I asked my sober friend if we could leave and he took me on like an hour drive to go pick up some friends from another party that got shut down.

I ate the rest of my MDMA as we were arriving back at the party around 11:30pm, at this time I was very stoned, rolling of MDMA and had nearly 750ml of spirits. I remember walking back into the party really well. Everyone was up dancing so I joined in and I had many people asking me where I went but I didnt say anything. I remeber I saw Jamie[17F] by herself looking really sad and she spotted me, walked up to me and hugged me. I was really pissed off with her so I didnt hug her back but I asked if she wanted to go outside and get some air, she said yeah but we just went outside and sat in silence for a few minutes. It was approaching midnight and we went back in to the party for the countdown and to continue dancing.

The party came to an end around 3:30am with Jamie[17F] sulking around me the whole time because the guy she invited rejected her. We ended up sharing an uber back to my hotel however her parents came and picked her up as soon as we arrived (she lived just down the road). I sort of feel like it was for the better because I went up to my room and vomited everywhere. I dont know if this is too much detail but the whole night made me kinda depressed because I didnt get want I was hoping for and Jamie made me feel like she wasnt interested in me at all.

The girl that I met earlier in the night, Sophie[18F], snapchatted me the next morning and we kept talking for the next few days till I dropped LSD with a few friends on the 1/3/18, three days later. I actually planned to see her that night but it didnt happen. 

A week went by and she kept texting me asking me when I would be in her town again(I lived an hour away but I commuted every day for school) and eventually I told her I would be in town on the 10th (1/10/18). I sort of went on a date with Bella[17F] but it dosent have any influence on the situation. After I saw Bella[17F] I texted Sophie[18F] and asked if she wanted to hang out but she said she was spending the night drinking with Kate[18F] and Jamie [17F]. I was still crushing on Jamie[17F] pretty hard so I texted her and asked what she was upto that night, she said she was with Kate and Sophie but they would come to dinner with me if I drove them(they were all drunk). I agreed and the four of us had dinner and I dropped them back home to Kate[18F]'s house where they were staying the night because her parents were not home. As I was pulling away Jamie[17F] ran up to my car and asked me if I wanted to stay the night with them, at first I was hesitant but I eventually agreed because I thought other guys were coming round. It turned out the other guys couldnt make it and it was just me and the three drunk girls. I asked Kate[18F](it was her house) if I could get some MDMA and drop it tonight and she agreed if I got her some.

I drove us to the bottle shop where Jamie[17F] got her friend to buy us some more alcohol and went to get the MDMA which me and Kate did while Jamie and Sophie just drank. The night was pretty chill but I distinctively remember Jamie[17F] kept trying to pick fights with me and got really pissy when I was talking to Sohpie[18F]. We ended up going swimming in Kate's pool around midnight and Sophie ended up taking her top off and was flashing me in the water. At this point me and Kate were really high on MDMA. We got out of the pool and me and Kate had soo much energy we just had to go for a walk while Sophie and Jamie were both being a bit of a drunken mess so we persuaded them to stay at Kates while me and her walked to a nearby park.

Armed with two packets of chewing gum, a few beers and a packet of cigarettes me and Kate left on a short walk that turned into two hours of an intense deep and meaningful session of confessions and secrets where we were holding each other around the waist as we told each other some of our most personal secrets. This was the first time I had ever really been alone around Kate and it felt like we really connected but on a strictly friendship level and we are really good friends now. She ended up admitting to me that Jamie[17F] the girl I had been crushing on wanted to have sex with me tonight, she was apparently waiting up back at Kate's house for me. 

The whole night Jamie had been picking fights with me and texting someone on her phone so as much as I was crushing on her I really wasn't interested. As soon as we arrived back Jamie came out of the room she was staying in with only T-shit and panties on, inviting me to come and sit next to her. I unfortunately was way too high on MDMA to sit still at this point and I ended up pacing around the room waking Sophie[18F] up, who was also craving some love off me. Kate took me aside and made it apparent to me that whoever I chose that night would be my final choice as the other girl would never talk to me again. I really wasn't feeling either of them and palmed them both off. Both Jamie and Sophie realised I wasn't interested and went back to bed where me and Kate stayed up all night listening to music. I left very early that next morning.

Two days after that (1/13/17) I came back into town to go to a party, hoping to see Jamie again I texted her and asked if she was coming, she replied she wasn't and I was kinda bummed out. I ended up meeting with Kate[18F] and our friendship founded two nights ago was very weird and it feels like Ive known her for years. I went round to her house to get ready for the party together and I get a snapchat from Sophie asking me if I was going to the party tonight. I didn't really want anything to to with her because I knew Jamie would hate me if I did so I told her Im not sure yet and when I decide she'll be the first to know.

When we got to the party Kate[18F] went off with her friends I was introduced to and was given some MDMA from. I took it and it was really strong and I don't really remember what I did that night but I was staying at Ben's house that night and he went home around 10pm because he wasn't feeling well so I told him I would be home around 1am and that I would just uber home. As soon as he left my phone DIED! It didn't run out of charge the screen just went black and didn't turn on so I was stranded at the party which was a good 20min drive away from Ben's place. A bunch of my friends were there but they all were leaving in different directions so I was begining to worry about how to get home when I spotted Sophie[18F] talking to a group of guys. I straight up walked up to her and asked how she was getting home, knowing she lived near Ben. She told me she was getting an uber and she had a seat for me if I found her when the party ended. I didn't feel like hanging with her so I organised to find her later.

This plan worked surprisingly well and where she gave me a lift to Ben's front door. In the back of the uber we got a bit touchy-feely with each other and I left her with a quick kiss on the lips to say thank you for the lift.

The next day me and Sophie snapchatted a bit and apparently I invited her over on Wednesday (today was Sunday), but she couldn't make Wednesday so she wanted to come round tomorrow. I agreed on the condition Jamie[17F] didn't find out. Well one thing led to another and I ended up having sex with Sophie, taking her virginity. I said to her when she first came round that whatever happened I wasn't interested in dating her and she agreed. Well I had a good time and I was actually pretty keen to see her again and I was happy no one else found out. I invited her round again on the next Wednesday. 

Wednesday comes around and I woke up at 11am with snapchats from Sophie asking what time to come round and JAMIE asking me what I was doing today. I was still half asleep and I didn't realise I was texting Jamie but I send a message that said something like: ""Sophie come round like 11am ;)"". Jamie opened it and was FURIOUS and was texting me about it all day while I had sex with Sophie twice.

Jamie blocked me on snapchat and wouldn't reply to anything I said so I kind of gave up trying to at least save our relationship because I really value her more then just for sex and she is a really good friend. Me and Sophie have known each other for 29 days at this point (since NYE) and we have met on a few occasions, having had sex three times. She left for college yesterday and I wont see her again till end of term break but we have been texting/calling everyday and has really been pressuring me into a relationship with her if I want to see her again.

Me and Sophie went to a party the night before she left and had sex in my car again but during the party Jamie got really drunk at her own place and unblocked me on snapchat and we texted most of the night while I was at the party. I was being really antisocial just texting her the whole time and she told me she never wanted to get with me ever again and was crying, tell me how much I betrayed her and hurt her, I told her I was sorry and I didn't know what to say. She said she wanted to see me that night but only if I agreed to never see Sophie again but I was with her that night, she knew that but still invited me round. I declined because I was with Sophie.

Starting tomorrow I go back to school and will see Jamie again for the first time since that night where we all stayed at Kate's house. Sophie has now moved two hours away for college and I wont see her again for 4 months but Ive still been texting her everyday and she's basically gave me an ultimatum between a relationship or not seeing her. I don't really want a relationship and the last one I had bunt out really quickly and the passion died very quickly however I want to see Sophie again but we will have to have a long distance relationship for a few months.

But at the same time I know I will never be able to talk to Jamie again unless she belive Im not involved with Sophie and I don't even know if we would get together ever again(I really want to and there will be lots of oppertunties in the next few months until Sophie gets back), but even if we didn't get together again I really do value and would be happy to have her as a friend.

I don't really know what to do and I know it seems like I just want it all right now. I feel like I know it would be wrong to try to have both of them at the same time but I think I could do it….. I really don't know what I should do because even if I didn't get with Jamie again I don't think she would want to have a friendship with me while I talked to Sohpie. How could I tell Sophie I want to see her again but don't want a relationship without hurting her feelings? How can I can rekindle my friendship with Jamie when she refuses to talk to me if I'm talking to Sophie, keeping further involvement out of it, although I wouldn't be opposed to getting back with her.

This all has happened within 29 days of the year and I feel like I'm going to hurt some feelings and burn some bridges I really value, already there have been lots of tears shed :/

7oj98d,"So I met this guy about 9 months ago at a meet-up group. We used to go out for drinks every other weekend and he'd always come on to me. We ended up hooking up a few times when drunk and became sort-of friends w/ benefits. It was the first time I'd done anything like that but he seemed like a natural flirter. But after a while, some personal stuff got in the way of his life and he took a break from the drinking/partying etc. He told me he needed to concentrate on getting his life together and apologized for having messed me around. I was cool with it all and he asked if we could stay friends. 

So we spent the next couple of months being platonic friends. He'd call and text me nearly every day, and we'd have these long late night chats. We'd meet up a few times a week and just hang out in coffee shops. We'd confide in each other about really personal things and we seemed to get really close. It was at this point I began to get real feelings for him, but I wasn't sure if he felt the same as he kept giving me mixed signals. He'd constantly be talking about dating other girls in front of me and boasting about how much attention he was getting on dating sites. I felt like he was trying to make me jealous. Then on the odd occasion he'd say something flirty to me. But in the same breath he'd tell me ""we wouldn't work as a couple anyway"" in a teasing way.

Then he decided he was going to go back into education, and get a part-time job as well. So he went from doing practically nothing (due to health reasons) to being very busy. Ever since then, his contact with me has drastically reduced. He went from texting/calling me every day to barely ever. I know he's made a lot of new friends and is busy with his job and studies now, but I guess I just miss how close we were. I feel like I'm now initiating all the contact whereas before it was always him. He's also flaking out on plans a lot more than he used to. On the rare occasions I do see him, I'm still so confused to what he wants from me. Three weeks ago, we had a really nice day together. When we were on the bus home he said to me ""remember when we were all over each other? what ever happened with that? we're both single now and both looking to date?"". I replied ""well I rarely hear from you anymore"" and he said ""yeah but do you....ah forget it"". 

A week later, he invited me on a night out with his sister and another friend. Only he seemed a little off with me for the whole night. I can't even put my finger on it, but I felt like he didn't even want me there. Then he started to flirt with this other girl and it made me feel uncomfortable so I went a bit quiet, which only seemed to annoy him more. At one point I snapped at him over something small and we had a brief argument. When the night was over he texted asking if I'd got home safe and I texted back ""just F off"". The next say he texted asking if I was okay. I replied ""yes I am"" and he said ""good"". That was the last time we spoke to each other.

It's been almost 2 weeks now and I haven't heard from him. My plan was to just take a step back and focus on myself for a while, but I still hoped he'd get in touch. I let him borrow my games console a couple of weeks ago so I need to get that back at some point. I just feel so frustrated because I think he knows I like him but he just seems to be playing with me. I miss how close we were before he got busy and I don't understand why he barely talks to me anymore, yet when he does see he says things like ""hey why aren't we dating?"" like its MY fault. But a week later he'll be flirting with someone else or saying ""I'm just too busy to date right now"".

7s0csc,"This is my first ever relationship. I've been with my bf for around a few months now. Well, technically not 'together-together'; it's long distance. (We met online.)

And that's the thing: It looks like the fact it is long distance makes it convenient for me emotionally, having an [Avoidant attachment style](https://www.psychalive.org/anxious-avoidant-attachment/).

Avoidant attachment means, I can be wary of emotional closeness, intimacy, or commitment. I have troubles with opening up. I keep people at a distance. I like to feel ""in control"" of my relationship(s).

I like our current set-up of meeting only once a month. (Though the fact we haven't seen each other for longer than 4 weeks by now is putting a strain on our relationship.) I have my space. I don't have to be constantly available in every sense of the word. I can hide behind a screen most of the time.

And this has been slowly dawning on me: how that set up fulfills my needs for distance and connection, and how losing it is making me  uncomfortable potentially.

I have become wary of the possibility everything may fall apart once we are seeing each other on a more regular basis, once we live together (for a little while; we've planned a couple of months of living together around the end of this year). I both want and don't want to be with him more often. I tend to keep some kind of distance still. I don't know what to do about it. 

I have written about my feelings before, and I realized how selfish they sounded. I wrote about how he met my needs, and how I don't miss him that much while we are apart (typical Dismissive thing for me – I don't miss people, at least not consciously), and how I sometimes focus more on how he makes me feel and less on his feelings. Even though I have been quite concerned about the questions of ""Does he like me? Will he stop liking me once we are together more often?"" etc; but perhaps those are just selfish questions that seek for validation. 

I am getting frustrated and turned off by the fact my love might just be immature and selfish: mostly revolving around myself.

I accept him as he is, and I find he's got admirable, attractive qualities. I support him in achieving his goals, even if I don't find them as relevant personally. Being around each other makes both of us happy, and I feel like he is my best friend, I haven't opened up as much to anyone else in a while; though he sometimes brings up how I could be ""more emotional"" and ""show my feelings more"". I can seem cold or as if I didn't care sometimes.

I have made some progress already; initially I was unable to tell him that I loved him, and that has changed. And there are moments when he can break through my walls and I start to feel all mushy and affectionate and it is like suddenly, my heart is open and free. But those moments are few and far in-between. I am afraid they are not ""true"". 

If I didn't like him, I wouldn't be with him. But... I don't know. I keep overthinking everything and I am worrying about what it would be like to be with him for an extended amount of time. What if it is horrible and we end up hating each other? I fear that I cannot deliver what he wants and deserves emotionally and sexually, and those fears stunt my ability to love him freely. I am wary of the fact I have no control over the outcome of that.

How can I move to a more mature kind of love that is less focused on me and my fears, and instead more about him and our relationship?",781,Q3,1,"Feeling like I am being selfish and immature, mostly focusing on my needs of distance and validation and less on those of my LDR bf.

7nk6dx,"OK! It's New Year's Day and I woke up alone, albeit with an extremely clean house...

Getting this ridiculous story out seems purgative and I hope it is entertaining to you! It all started in July when I broke up with my Dead Bedroom boyfriend of 12 years. You see, we hadn't had sex in nearly 9 years. I had become the generic girlfriend a seemingly permanent and unchanging fixture. An appliance to be used to ferry cars around or shop for groceries as needed.

One day, we went to pick up his car from getting repaired. I was feeling particularly sad after talking with his Mom about end of life rights and unmarried couples, ie, they don't have any. The boyfriend starts chatting with the Service Writer at the shop, a friend of ours, when suddenly, our friend turns to me and asks about my car and how it's doing.

Now, that might seem mundane and most likely a simple attempt to drum up business. But this is no ordinary shop, this is a place for hobbyist vehicles and hotrods. It's an enthusiast's shop staffed by passionate motorsport fanatics. Our friend asking me specifically about my car (that I have put a lot of work into) gave me an instant lady boner if you'll pardon the vulgarity.

Later that week I broke up with Mr. Dead Bedroom.

Over the next few weeks I made a point to chat more with Mr. Cares-about-my-Car and we started becoming closer friends. It was an unfamiliar feeling after so long being isolated within my old relationship.

Finally, the time came for me to bring my car in for service. I called up my friend and arranged the time, got myself dressed up in a cute outfit and put on my best smile.

I arrived at the shop all excited to go for a ride with my friend so we could figure out why my car was making that funny noise....You know, some quality alone time for a couple car geeks. But instead of being whisked away on a test drive with my crush I get shuffled off to a greasy garage bay to meet the lead mechanic who will be helping me with the diagnostics.

WTF. I wanted to go for a ride with with my crush...the obscenities and hurtful mutterings under my breath as I stomped over to the lift do not bear repeating.

The lead mech had his back to me as I approached so I had a split second to put on my finest Southern Woman's Friendly Face before he turned around and nearly blinded me with the sunbeams and sparkles emanating from his smile.

Maybe I was just so starved for male attention that my standards aren't as high as usual, but goddamn, he is the second most attractive man I have ever met. Just for completeness I will mention that I have met David Coulthard so the top slot has to go to him. Just sayin'.

To say I was flustered is to understate things. On the test drive He just started hitting all my buttons with all the things we had in common, his wit, his this and that and blah blah blah...I had completely forgotten about my crush and was so worked up by this guy that I actually pulled my shift knob off while driving. It happens...just usually not to me. He fixed it on the spot no problem and we got back to the shop despite my dreamy eyes seeing everything in soft focus.

The next couple months saw me at the shop just hanging out and talking cars and just about any esoteric topic that could possibly be talked about. I became closer friends with my original crush and I started liking Mr. McDreamy even more. I got to know the owner of the shop and the other mechanics. It actually started to feel like a group of friends, and it was nice.

Then came the night. Texting with Mr. McDreamy. The ex-bf, Mr. Dead Bedroom, had gone to a party several hours away and I had the house to myself. Yes, the ex still. lived. with. me. ugh.

Anyway, I was fixin' to watch the F1 race on that evening and I just up and asked Mr. McDreamy if he wanted to come over. He did, we watched the race and yadda yadda yadda ok that was fun.

The problem was Mr. McDreamy got nervous about Mr. Dead Bedroom coming back and made a hasty exit. He didn't text me. He was awkwardistant until I made an overt and bold move to include him in a round of hello hugs at the shop. Then he was all about the textiness.

No calls, just text. Hell I even went over to bake cinnamon rolls at his house (I have no oven atm...different story) and arranged the whole thing via text...then he fell asleep on the couch. Oh well. After I went home he went right back to texting. He still texts to this day...

I made him a really nice very personal Christmas present with a blatant propaganda piece...ie note/letter about how great I think he is. I wanted to give it to him at the shop party but he was too cool to show.

Nevermind, his apprentice swooped in and took up the slack. For his 21 years he is pretty smooth...

I did not make the mistake of bringing this young Chris Hemsworth doppelganger back to my house where Mr. Dead Bedroom was grumpily being a huge rooster block. So although clothes stayed on we became more acquainted than before.

Moving on to the following workday, I went over to the shop to collect the dishes from the stuff I brought to the party. I had a beer and chilled with the gang. Then the owner of the shop busts out with his wife's concerns that he and I were ""after each other"".

My not-so-savvy self didn't know what he meant at first. But as the realization washed over me that I was being suspected of an affair I was mortified horrified and shamified. I stayed only a few minutes more then made as dignified an exit as I could.

So here I am. My current situation is single but (until yesterday...hence the uber cleaning of my house) living with ex, friend-zoned, jilted, desired and the suspected other woman.

This would all be fine for the uncomfortable fact that I have had sex with exactly one person exactly one time in the past 9 years and somehow I am the shop slut. All I really want is an adventure partner to go on adventures and be adventuresome with.

I am very unhappy right now and I don't know how to go on. I don't want to leave this group of friends because outside of what I wrote here, there is a lot of solid awesomeness in the group. But I really want to find a companion. Is online dating a better option? Meetup groups? I just don't know.

Thank you for checking out my silly story.
