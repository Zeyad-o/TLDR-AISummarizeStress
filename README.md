# TLDR-AISummarizeStress
Greetings,


Here, we will give a sample code and a sample of the dataset, hoping to release the complete dataset and the needed code by the conference date.
We provide a sample of 60 post_ids (with different length distributions) in addition to the extended posts, their extracted human summaries/ TLDRs, and their generated AI summaries.
Below is the pipeline for our work
